Description
===========

The **cmake** executable is the command-line interface of the cross-platform
buildsystem generator CMake.  The above Synopsis lists various actions
the tool can perform as described in sections below.

To build a software project with CMake, Generate a Project Buildsystem.
Optionally use **cmake** to Build a Project, Install a Project or just
run the corresponding build tool (e.g. ``make``) directly.  **cmake** can also
be used to View Help.

The other actions are meant for use by software developers writing
scripts in the ``CMake language`` to support
their builds.

For graphical user interfaces that may be used in place of **cmake**,
see ``ccmake`` and ``cmake-gui``.
For command-line interfaces to the CMake testing and packaging facilities,
see ``ctest`` and ``cpack``.

For more information on CMake at large, see also the links at the end
of this manual.


Introduction to CMake Buildsystems
==================================

A *buildsystem* describes how to build a project's executables and libraries
from its source code using a *build tool* to automate the process.  For
example, a buildsystem may be a ``Makefile`` for use with a command-line
``make`` tool or a project file for an Integrated Development Environment
(IDE).  In order to avoid maintaining multiple such buildsystems, a project
may specify its buildsystem abstractly using files written in the
``CMake language``.  From these files CMake
generates a preferred buildsystem locally for each user through a backend
called a *generator*.

To generate a buildsystem with CMake, the following must be selected:

Source Tree
  The top-level directory containing source files provided by the project.
  The project specifies its buildsystem using files as described in the
  ``cmake-language(7)`` manual, starting with a top-level file named
  ``CMakeLists.txt``.  These files specify build targets and their
  dependencies as described in the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual.

Build Tree
  The top-level directory in which buildsystem files and build output
  artifacts (e.g. executables and libraries) are to be stored.
  CMake will write a ``CMakeCache.txt`` file to identify the directory
  as a build tree and store persistent information such as buildsystem
  configuration options.

  To maintain a pristine source tree, perform an *out-of-source* build
  by using a separate dedicated build tree.  An *in-source* build in
  which the build tree is placed in the same directory as the source
  tree is also supported, but discouraged.

Generator
  This chooses the kind of buildsystem to generate.  See the
  ``cmake-generators(7)`` manual for documentation of all generators.
  Run ``cmake --help`` to see a list of generators available locally.
  Optionally use the ``-G`` option below to specify a generator, or simply
  accept the default CMake chooses for the current platform.

  When using one of the :ref:`Command-Line Build Tool Generators`
  CMake expects that the environment needed by the compiler toolchain
  is already configured in the shell.  When using one of the
  :ref:`IDE Build Tool Generators`, no particular environment is needed.


Generate a Project Buildsystem
==============================

Run CMake with one of the following command signatures to specify the
source and build trees and generate a buildsystem:

``cmake [<options>] <path-to-source>``
  Uses the current working directory as the build tree, and
  ``<path-to-source>`` as the source tree.  The specified path may
  be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
  The source tree must contain a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file and must
  *not* contain a ``CMakeCache.txt`` file because the latter
  identifies an existing build tree.  For example:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ mkdir build ; cd build
    $ cmake ../src

``cmake [<options>] <path-to-existing-build>``
  Uses ``<path-to-existing-build>`` as the build tree, and loads the
  path to the source tree from its ``CMakeCache.txt`` file, which must
  have already been generated by a previous run of CMake.  The specified
  path may be absolute or relative to the current working directory.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cd build
    $ cmake .

``cmake [<options>] -S <path-to-source> -B <path-to-build>``
  Uses ``<path-to-build>`` as the build tree and ``<path-to-source>``
  as the source tree.  The specified paths may be absolute or relative
  to the current working directory.  The source tree must contain a
  ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.  The build tree will be created automatically
  if it does not already exist.  For example:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ cmake -S src -B build

In all cases the ``<options>`` may be zero or more of the Options below.

After generating a buildsystem one may use the corresponding native
build tool to build the project.  For example, after using the
``Unix Makefiles`` generator one may run ``make`` directly:

  .. code-block:: console

    $ make
    $ make install

Alternatively, one may use **cmake** to Build a Project by
automatically choosing and invoking the appropriate native build tool.

Options
-------

``-S <path-to-source>``
 Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

``-B <path-to-build>``
 Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.

 If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

``-C <initial-cache>``
 Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

 When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
 ``CMakeCache.txt`` file and populates it with customizable settings for
 the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
 to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's
 CMake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the
 project's default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
 containing ``set()`` commands that use the ``CACHE`` option, not a
 cache-format file.

 References to ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``
 within the script evaluate to the top-level source and build tree.

``-D <var>:<type>=<value>, -D <var>=<value>``
 Create or update a CMake ``CACHE`` entry.

 When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
 ``CMakeCache.txt`` file and populates it with customizable settings for
 the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
 takes priority over the project's default value.  The option may be
 repeated for as many ``CACHE`` entries as desired.

 If the ``:<type>`` portion is given it must be one of the types
 specified by the ``set()`` command documentation for its
 ``CACHE`` signature.
 If the ``:<type>`` portion is omitted the entry will be created
 with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a
 command in the project sets the type to ``PATH`` or ``FILEPATH``
 then the ``<value>`` will be converted to an absolute path.

 This option may also be given as a single argument:
 ``-D<var>:<type>=<value>`` or ``-D<var>=<value>``.

``-U <globbing_expr>``
 Remove matching entries from CMake ``CACHE``.

 This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
 ``CMakeCache.txt`` file, globbing expressions using ``*`` and ``?`` are
 supported.  The option may be repeated for as many ``CACHE`` entries as
 desired.

 Use with care, you can make your ``CMakeCache.txt`` non-working.

``-G <generator-name>``
 Specify a build system generator.

 CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain
 platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular
 build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
 ``cmake-generators(7)`` manual.

 If not specified, CMake checks the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` environment
 variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection.

``-T <toolset-spec>``
 Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

 Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell
 the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the
 ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

``-A <platform-name>``
 Specify platform name if supported by generator.

 Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
 native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the
 ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable for details.

``-Wno-dev``
 Suppress developer warnings.

 Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
 ``CMakeLists.txt`` files. By default this will also turn off
 deprecation warnings.

``-Wdev``
 Enable developer warnings.

 Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt``
 files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings.

``-Werror=dev``
 Make developer warnings errors.

 Make warnings that are meant for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files
 errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.

``-Wno-error=dev``
 Make developer warnings not errors.

 Make warnings that are meant for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files not
 errors. By default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

``-Wdeprecated``
 Enable deprecated functionality warnings.

 Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

``-Wno-deprecated``
 Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.

 Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

``-Werror=deprecated``
 Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.

 Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files, errors.

``-Wno-error=deprecated``
 Make deprecated macro and function warnings not errors.

 Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files, not errors.

``-L[A][H]``
 List non-advanced cached variables.

 List ``CACHE`` variables will run CMake and list all the variables from
 the CMake ``CACHE`` that are not marked as ``INTERNAL`` or ``ADVANCED``.
 This will effectively display current CMake settings, which can then be
 changed with ``-D`` option.  Changing some of the variables may result
 in more variables being created.  If ``A`` is specified, then it will
 display also advanced variables.  If ``H`` is specified, it will also
 display help for each variable.

``-N``
 View mode only.

 Only load the cache.  Do not actually run configure and generate
 steps.

``--graphviz=[file]``
 Generate graphviz of dependencies, see ``CMakeGraphVizOptions`` for more.

 Generate a graphviz input file that will contain all the library and
 executable dependencies in the project.  See the documentation for
 ``CMakeGraphVizOptions`` for more details.

``--system-information [file]``
 Dump information about this system.

 Dump a wide range of information about the current system.  If run
 from the top of a binary tree for a CMake project it will dump
 additional information such as the cache, log files etc.

``--log-level=<ERROR|WARNING|NOTICE|STATUS|VERBOSE|DEBUG|TRACE>``
 Set the log level.

 The ``message()`` command will only output messages of the specified
 log level or higher.  The default log level is ``STATUS``.

 For backward compatibility reasons, ``--loglevel`` is also accepted as a
 synonym for this option.

``--debug-trycompile``
 Do not delete the ``try_compile()`` build tree.
 Only useful on one ``try_compile()`` at a time.

 Do not delete the files and directories created for ``try_compile()``
 calls.  This is useful in debugging failed try_compiles.  It may
 however change the results of the try-compiles as old junk from a
 previous try-compile may cause a different test to either pass or
 fail incorrectly.  This option is best used for one try-compile at a
 time, and only when debugging.

``--debug-output``
 Put cmake in a debug mode.

 Print extra information during the cmake run like stack traces with
 ``message(SEND_ERROR)`` calls.

``--trace``
 Put cmake in trace mode.

 Print a trace of all calls made and from where.

``--trace-expand``
 Put cmake in trace mode.

 Like ``--trace``, but with variables expanded.

``--trace-source=<file>``
 Put cmake in trace mode, but output only lines of a specified file.

 Multiple options are allowed.

``--trace-redirect=<file>``
 Put cmake in trace mode and redirect trace output to a file instead of stderr.

``--warn-uninitialized``
 Warn about uninitialized values.

 Print a warning when an uninitialized variable is used.

``--warn-unused-vars``
 Warn about unused variables.

 Find variables that are declared or set, but not used.

``--no-warn-unused-cli``
 Don't warn about command line options.

 Don't find variables that are declared on the command line, but not
 used.

``--check-system-vars``
 Find problems with variable usage in system files.

 Normally, unused and uninitialized variables are searched for only
 in ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``.
 This flag tells CMake to warn about other files as well.

Build a Project
===============

CMake provides a command-line signature to build an already-generated
project binary tree:

 cmake --build <dir> [<options>] [-- <build-tool-options>]

This abstracts a native build tool's command-line interface with the
following options:

``--build <dir>``
  Project binary directory to be built.  This is required and must be first.

``--parallel [<jobs>], -j [<jobs>]``
  The maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building.
  If ``<jobs>`` is omitted the native build tool's default number is used.

  The ``CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL`` environment variable, if set,
  specifies a default parallel level when this option is not given.

  Some native build tools always build in parallel.  The use of ``<jobs>``
  value of ``1`` can be used to limit to a single job.

``--target <tgt>..., -t <tgt>...``
  Build ``<tgt>`` instead of the default target.  Multiple targets may be
  given, separated by spaces.

``--config <cfg>``
  For multi-configuration tools, choose configuration ``<cfg>``.

``--clean-first``
  Build target ``clean`` first, then build.
  (To clean only, use ``--target clean``.)

``--use-stderr``
  Ignored.  Behavior is default in CMake >= 3.0.

``--verbose, -v``
  Enable verbose output - if supported - including the build commands to be
  executed.

  This option can be omitted if ``VERBOSE`` environment variable or
  ``CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE`` cached variable is set.


``--``
  Pass remaining options to the native tool.

Run ``cmake --build`` with no options for quick help.

Install a Project
=================

CMake provides a command-line signature to install an already-generated
project binary tree:

 cmake --install <dir> [<options>]

This may be used after building a project to run installation without
using the generated build system or the native build tool.
The options are:

``--install <dir>``
  Project binary directory to install. This is required and must be first.

``--config <cfg>``
  For multi-configuration generators, choose configuration ``<cfg>``.

``--component <comp>``
  Component-based install. Only install component ``<comp>``.

``--prefix <prefix>``
  Override the installation prefix, ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

``--strip``
  Strip before installing.

``-v, --verbose``
  Enable verbose output.

  This option can be omitted if ``VERBOSE`` environment variable is set.

Run ``cmake --install`` with no options for quick help.

Open a Project
==============

 cmake --open <dir>

Open the generated project in the associated application.  This is only
supported by some generators.


Run a Script
============

 cmake [{-D <var>=<value>}...] -P <cmake-script-file>

Process the given cmake file as a script written in the CMake
language.  No configure or generate step is performed and the cache
is not modified.  If variables are defined using ``-D``, this must be
done before the ``-P`` argument.


Run a Command-Line Tool
=======================

CMake provides builtin command-line tools through the signature

 cmake -E <command> [<options>]

Run ``cmake -E`` or ``cmake -E help`` for a summary of commands.
Available commands are:

``capabilities``
  Report cmake capabilities in JSON format. The output is a JSON object
  with the following keys:

  ``version``
    A JSON object with version information. Keys are:

    ``string``
      The full version string as displayed by cmake ``--version``.
    ``major``
      The major version number in integer form.
    ``minor``
      The minor version number in integer form.
    ``patch``
      The patch level in integer form.
    ``suffix``
      The cmake version suffix string.
    ``isDirty``
      A bool that is set if the cmake build is from a dirty tree.

  ``generators``
    A list available generators. Each generator is a JSON object with the
    following keys:

    ``name``
      A string containing the name of the generator.
    ``toolsetSupport``
      ``true`` if the generator supports toolsets and ``false`` otherwise.
    ``platformSupport``
      ``true`` if the generator supports platforms and ``false`` otherwise.
    ``extraGenerators``
      A list of strings with all the extra generators compatible with
      the generator.

  ``fileApi``
    Optional member that is present when the ``cmake-file-api(7)``
    is available.  The value is a JSON object with one member:

    ``requests``
      A JSON array containing zero or more supported file-api requests.
      Each request is a JSON object with members:

      ``kind``
        Specifies one of the supported :ref:`file-api object kinds`.

      ``version``
        A JSON array whose elements are each a JSON object containing
        ``major`` and ``minor`` members specifying non-negative integer
        version components.

  ``serverMode``
    ``true`` if cmake supports server-mode and ``false`` otherwise.

``chdir <dir> <cmd> [<arg>...]``
  Change the current working directory and run a command.

``compare_files [--ignore-eol] <file1> <file2>``
  Check if ``<file1>`` is same as ``<file2>``. If files are the same,
  then returns ``0``, if not it returns ``1``.  The ``--ignore-eol`` option
  implies line-wise comparison and ignores LF/CRLF differences.

``copy <file>... <destination>``
  Copy files to ``<destination>`` (either file or directory).
  If multiple files are specified, the ``<destination>`` must be
  directory and it must exist. Wildcards are not supported.
  ``copy`` does follow symlinks. That means it does not copy symlinks,
  but the files or directories it point to.

``copy_directory <dir>... <destination>``
  Copy content of ``<dir>...`` directories to ``<destination>`` directory.
  If ``<destination>`` directory does not exist it will be created.
  ``copy_directory`` does follow symlinks.

``copy_if_different <file>... <destination>``
  Copy files to ``<destination>`` (either file or directory) if
  they have changed.
  If multiple files are specified, the ``<destination>`` must be
  directory and it must exist.
  ``copy_if_different`` does follow symlinks.

``create_symlink <old> <new>``
  Create a symbolic link ``<new>`` naming ``<old>``.

  .. note::
    Path to where ``<new>`` symbolic link will be created has to exist beforehand.

``echo [<string>...]``
  Displays arguments as text.

``echo_append [<string>...]``
  Displays arguments as text but no new line.

``env [--unset=NAME]... [NAME=VALUE]... COMMAND [ARG]...``
  Run command in a modified environment.

``environment``
  Display the current environment variables.

``false``
  Do nothing, with an exit code of 1.

``make_directory <dir>...``
  Create ``<dir>`` directories.  If necessary, create parent
  directories too.  If a directory already exists it will be
  silently ignored.

``md5sum <file>...``
  Create MD5 checksum of files in ``md5sum`` compatible format::

 351abe79cd3800b38cdfb25d45015a15  file1.txt
 052f86c15bbde68af55c7f7b340ab639  file2.txt

``sha1sum <file>...``
  Create SHA1 checksum of files in ``sha1sum`` compatible format::

 4bb7932a29e6f73c97bb9272f2bdc393122f86e0  file1.txt
 1df4c8f318665f9a5f2ed38f55adadb7ef9f559c  file2.txt

``sha224sum <file>...``
  Create SHA224 checksum of files in ``sha224sum`` compatible format::

``remove [-f] <file>...``
  Remove the file(s). If any of the listed files already do not
  exist, the command returns a non-zero exit code, but no message
  is logged. The ``-f`` option changes the behavior to return a
  zero exit code (i.e. success) in such situations instead.
  ``remove`` does not follow symlinks. That means it remove only symlinks
  and not files it point to.

``remove_directory <dir>...``
  Remove ``<dir>`` directories and their contents.  If a directory does
  not exist it will be silently ignored.  If ``<dir>`` is a symlink to
  a directory, just the symlink will be removed.

``rename <oldname> <newname>``
  Rename a file or directory (on one volume). If file with the ``<newname>`` name
  already exists, then it will be silently replaced.

``server``
  Launch ``cmake-server(7)`` mode.

``sleep <number>...``
  Sleep for given number of seconds.

``tar [cxt][vf][zjJ] file.tar [<options>] [--] [<pathname>...]``
  Create or extract a tar or zip archive.  Options are:

  ``c``
    Create a new archive containing the specified files.
    If used, the ``<pathname>...`` argument is mandatory.
  ``x``
    Extract to disk from the archive.
    The ``<pathname>...`` argument could be used to extract only selected files
    or directories.
    When extracting selected files or directories, you must provide their exact
    names including the path, as printed by list (``-t``).
  ``t``
    List archive contents.
    The ``<pathname>...`` argument could be used to list only selected files
    or directories.
  ``v``
    Produce verbose output.
  ``z``
    Compress the resulting archive with gzip.
  ``j``
    Compress the resulting archive with bzip2.
  ``J``
    Compress the resulting archive with XZ.
  ``--zstd``
    Compress the resulting archive with Zstandard.
  ``--files-from=<file>``
    Read file names from the given file, one per line.
    Blank lines are ignored.  Lines may not start in ``-``
    except for ``--add-file=<name>`` to add files whose
    names start in ``-``.
  ``--format=<format>``
    Specify the format of the archive to be created.
    Supported formats are: ``7zip``, ``gnutar``, ``pax``,
    ``paxr`` (restricted pax, default), and ``zip``.
  ``--mtime=<date>``
    Specify modification time recorded in tarball entries.
  ``--``
    Stop interpreting options and treat all remaining arguments
    as file names, even if they start with ``-``.


``time <command> [<args>...]``
  Run command and display elapsed time.

``touch <file>...``
  Creates ``<file>`` if file do not exist.
  If ``<file>`` exists, it is changing ``<file>`` access and modification times.

``touch_nocreate <file>...``
  Touch a file if it exists but do not create it.  If a file does
  not exist it will be silently ignored.

``true``
  Do nothing, with an exit code of 0.

Windows-specific Command-Line Tools
-----------------------------------

The following ``cmake -E`` commands are available only on Windows:

``delete_regv <key>``
  Delete Windows registry value.

``env_vs8_wince <sdkname>``
  Displays a batch file which sets the environment for the provided
  Windows CE SDK installed in VS2005.

``env_vs9_wince <sdkname>``
  Displays a batch file which sets the environment for the provided
  Windows CE SDK installed in VS2008.

``write_regv <key> <value>``
  Write Windows registry value.


Run the Find-Package Tool
=========================

CMake provides a pkg-config like helper for Makefile-based projects:

 cmake --find-package [<options>]

It searches a package using ``find_package()`` and prints the
resulting flags to stdout.  This can be used instead of pkg-config
to find installed libraries in plain Makefile-based projects or in
autoconf-based projects (via ``share/aclocal/cmake.m4``).

.. note::
  This mode is not well-supported due to some technical limitations.
  It is kept for compatibility but should not be used in new projects.


View Help
=========

To print selected pages from the CMake documentation, use

 cmake --help[-<topic>]

with one of the following options:

``--help,-help,-usage,-h,-H,/?``
 Print usage information and exit.

 Usage describes the basic command line interface and its options.

``--version,-version,/V [<f>]``
 Show program name/version banner and exit.

 If a file is specified, the version is written into it.
 The help is printed to a named <f>ile if given.

``--help-full [<f>]``
 Print all help manuals and exit.

 All manuals are printed in a human-readable text format.
 The help is printed to a named <f>ile if given.

``--help-manual <man> [<f>]``
 Print one help manual and exit.

 The specified manual is printed in a human-readable text format.
 The help is printed to a named <f>ile if given.

ctest(1)
********

Synopsis
========

 ctest [<options>]
 ctest --build-and-test <path-to-source> <path-to-build>
       --build-generator <generator> [<options>...]
       [--build-options <opts>...] [--test-command <command> [<args>...]]
 ctest {-D <dashboard> | -M <model> -T <action> | -S <script> | -SP <script>}
       [-- <dashboard-options>...]

Description
===========

The **ctest** executable is the CMake test driver program.
CMake-generated build trees created for projects that use the
``enable_testing()`` and ``add_test()`` commands have testing support.
This program will run the tests and report results.

Options
=======

``-C <cfg>, --build-config <cfg>``
 Choose configuration to test.

 Some CMake-generated build trees can have multiple build
 configurations in the same tree.  This option can be used to specify
 which one should be tested.  Example configurations are ``Debug`` and
 ``Release``.

``--progress``
 Enable short progress output from tests.

 When the output of **ctest** is being sent directly to a terminal, the
 progress through the set of tests is reported by updating the same line
 rather than printing start and end messages for each test on new lines.
 This can significantly reduce the verbosity of the test output.
 Test completion messages are still output on their own line for failed
 tests and the final test summary will also still be logged.

 This option can also be enabled by setting the environment variable
 ``CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT``.

``-V,--verbose``
 Enable verbose output from tests.

 Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
 displayed.  This option will show all test output.

``-VV,--extra-verbose``
 Enable more verbose output from tests.

 Test output is normally suppressed and only summary information is
 displayed.  This option will show even more test output.

``--debug``
 Displaying more verbose internals of CTest.

 This feature will result in a large number of output that is mostly
 useful for debugging dashboard problems.

``--output-on-failure``
 Output anything outputted by the test program if the test should fail.
 This option can also be enabled by setting the
 ``CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE`` environment variable

``-F``
 Enable failover.

 This option allows CTest to resume a test set execution that was
 previously interrupted.  If no interruption occurred, the ``-F`` option
 will have no effect.

``-j <jobs>, --parallel <jobs>``
 Run the tests in parallel using the given number of jobs.

 This option tells CTest to run the tests in parallel using given
 number of jobs. This option can also be set by setting the
 ``CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL`` environment variable.

 This option can be used with the ``PROCESSORS`` test property.

 See Label and Subproject Summary.

``--hardware-spec-file <file>``
 Run CTest with :ref:`hardware allocation <ctest-hardware-allocation>` enabled,
 using the
 :ref:`hardware specification file <ctest-hardware-specification-file>`
 specified in ``<file>``.

 When ``ctest`` is run as a Dashboard Client this sets the
 ``HardwareSpecFile`` option of the CTest Test Step.

``--test-load <level>``
 While running tests in parallel (e.g. with ``-j``), try not to start
 tests when they may cause the CPU load to pass above a given threshold.

 When ``ctest`` is run as a Dashboard Client this sets the
 ``TestLoad`` option of the CTest Test Step.

``-Q,--quiet``
 Make CTest quiet.

 This option will suppress all the output.  The output log file will
 still be generated if the ``--output-log`` is specified.  Options such
 as ``--verbose``, ``--extra-verbose``, and ``--debug`` are ignored
 if ``--quiet`` is specified.

``-O <file>, --output-log <file>``
 Output to log file.

 This option tells CTest to write all its output to a ``<file>`` log file.

``-N,--show-only[=<format>]``
 Disable actual execution of tests.

 This option tells CTest to list the tests that would be run but not
 actually run them.  Useful in conjunction with the ``-R`` and ``-E``
 options.

 ``<format>`` can be one of the following values.

   ``human``
     Human-friendly output.  This is not guaranteed to be stable.
     This is the default.

   ``json-v1``
     Dump the test information in JSON format.
     See Show as JSON Object Model.

``-L <regex>, --label-regex <regex>``
 Run tests with labels matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose labels match the
 given regular expression.

``-R <regex>, --tests-regex <regex>``
 Run tests matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to run only the tests whose names match the
 given regular expression.

``-E <regex>, --exclude-regex <regex>``
 Exclude tests matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose names match the
 given regular expression.

``-LE <regex>, --label-exclude <regex>``
 Exclude tests with labels matching regular expression.

 This option tells CTest to NOT run the tests whose labels match the
 given regular expression.

``-FA <regex>, --fixture-exclude-any <regex>``
 Exclude fixtures matching ``<regex>`` from automatically adding any tests to
 the test set.

 If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture,
 that fixture's setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test set
 automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
 matching the ``<regex>``. Note that all other fixture behavior is retained,
 including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture setup tests
 that fail.

``-FS <regex>, --fixture-exclude-setup <regex>``
 Same as ``-FA`` except only matching setup tests are excluded.

``-FC <regex>, --fixture-exclude-cleanup <regex>``
 Same as ``-FA`` except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.

``-D <dashboard>, --dashboard <dashboard>``
 Execute dashboard test.

 This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client and perform a
 dashboard test.  All tests are ``<Mode><Test>``, where ``<Mode>`` can be
 ``Experimental``, ``Nightly``, and ``Continuous``, and ``<Test>`` can be
 ``Start``, ``Update``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``,
 ``Coverage``, and ``Submit``.

 See Dashboard Client.

``-D <var>:<type>=<value>``
 Define a variable for script mode.

 Pass in variable values on the command line.  Use in conjunction
 with ``-S`` to pass variable values to a dashboard script.  Parsing ``-D``
 arguments as variable values is only attempted if the value
 following ``-D`` does not match any of the known dashboard types.

``-M <model>, --test-model <model>``
 Sets the model for a dashboard.

 This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client where the ``<model>``
 can be ``Experimental``, ``Nightly``, and ``Continuous``.
 Combining ``-M`` and ``-T`` is similar to ``-D``.

 See Dashboard Client.

``-T <action>, --test-action <action>``
 Sets the dashboard action to perform.

 This option tells CTest to act as a CDash client and perform some
 action such as ``start``, ``build``, ``test`` etc. See
 Dashboard Client Steps for the full list of actions.
 Combining ``-M`` and ``-T`` is similar to ``-D``.

 See Dashboard Client.

``-S <script>, --script <script>``
 Execute a dashboard for a configuration.

 This option tells CTest to load in a configuration script which sets
 a number of parameters such as the binary and source directories.
 Then CTest will do what is required to create and run a dashboard.
 This option basically sets up a dashboard and then runs ``ctest -D``
 with the appropriate options.

 See Dashboard Client.

``-SP <script>, --script-new-process <script>``
 Execute a dashboard for a configuration.

 This option does the same operations as ``-S`` but it will do them in a
 separate process.  This is primarily useful in cases where the
 script may modify the environment and you do not want the modified
 environment to impact other ``-S`` scripts.

 See Dashboard Client.

``-I [Start,End,Stride,test#,test#|Test file], --tests-information``
 Run a specific number of tests by number.

 This option causes CTest to run tests starting at number ``Start``,
 ending at number ``End``, and incrementing by ``Stride``.  Any additional
 numbers after ``Stride`` are considered individual test numbers.  ``Start``,
 ``End``, or ``Stride`` can be empty.  Optionally a file can be given that
 contains the same syntax as the command line.

``-U, --union``
 Take the Union of ``-I`` and ``-R``.

 When both ``-R`` and ``-I`` are specified by default the intersection of
 tests are run.  By specifying ``-U`` the union of tests is run instead.

``--rerun-failed``
 Run only the tests that failed previously.

 This option tells CTest to perform only the tests that failed during
 its previous run.  When this option is specified, CTest ignores all
 other options intended to modify the list of tests to run (``-L``, ``-R``,
 ``-E``, ``-LE``, ``-I``, etc).  In the event that CTest runs and no tests
 fail, subsequent calls to CTest with the ``--rerun-failed`` option will run
 the set of tests that most recently failed (if any).

``--repeat-until-fail <n>``
 Require each test to run ``<n>`` times without failing in order to pass.

 This is useful in finding sporadic failures in test cases.

``--max-width <width>``
 Set the max width for a test name to output.

 Set the maximum width for each test name to show in the output.
 This allows the user to widen the output to avoid clipping the test
 name which can be very annoying.

``--interactive-debug-mode [0|1]``
 Set the interactive mode to ``0`` or ``1``.

 This option causes CTest to run tests in either an interactive mode
 or a non-interactive mode.  On Windows this means that in
 non-interactive mode, all system debug pop up windows are blocked.
 In dashboard mode (``Experimental``, ``Nightly``, ``Continuous``), the default
 is non-interactive.  When just running tests not for a dashboard the
 default is to allow popups and interactive debugging.

``--no-label-summary``
 Disable timing summary information for labels.

 This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each
 label associated with the tests run.  If there are no labels on the
 tests, nothing extra is printed.

 See Label and Subproject Summary.

``--no-subproject-summary``
 Disable timing summary information for subprojects.

 This option tells CTest not to print summary information for each
 subproject associated with the tests run.  If there are no subprojects on the
 tests, nothing extra is printed.

 See Label and Subproject Summary.

``--build-and-test``
See Build and Test Mode.

``--test-output-size-passed <size>``
 Limit the output for passed tests to ``<size>`` bytes.

``--test-output-size-failed <size>``
 Limit the output for failed tests to ``<size>`` bytes.

``--overwrite``
 Overwrite CTest configuration option.

 By default CTest uses configuration options from configuration file.
 This option will overwrite the configuration option.

``--force-new-ctest-process``
 Run child CTest instances as new processes.

 By default CTest will run child CTest instances within the same
 process.  If this behavior is not desired, this argument will
 enforce new processes for child CTest processes.

``--schedule-random``
 Use a random order for scheduling tests.

 This option will run the tests in a random order.  It is commonly
 used to detect implicit dependencies in a test suite.

``--submit-index``
 Legacy option for old Dart2 dashboard server feature.
 Do not use.

``--timeout <seconds>``
 Set the default test timeout.

 This option effectively sets a timeout on all tests that do not
 already have a timeout set on them via the ``TIMEOUT``
 property.

``--stop-time <time>``
 Set a time at which all tests should stop running.

 Set a real time of day at which all tests should timeout.  Example:
 ``7:00:00 -0400``.  Any time format understood by the curl date parser
 is accepted.  Local time is assumed if no timezone is specified.

``--print-labels``
 Print all available test labels.

 This option will not run any tests, it will simply print the list of
 all labels associated with the test set.

``--help,-help,-usage,-h,-H,/?``
 Print usage information and exit.

 Usage describes the basic command line interface and its options.

``--version,-version,/V [<f>]``

Label and Subproject Summary
============================

CTest prints timing summary information for each ``LABEL`` and subproject
associated with the tests run. The label time summary will not include labels
that are mapped to subprojects.

When the ``PROCESSORS`` test property is set, CTest will display a
weighted test timing result in label and subproject summaries. The time is
reported with `sec*proc` instead of just `sec`.

The weighted time summary reported for each label or subproject ``j``
is computed as::

 Weighted Time Summary for Label/Subproject j =
     sum(raw_test_time[j,i] * num_processors[j,i], i=1...num_tests[j])

 for labels/subprojects j=1...total

where:

* ``raw_test_time[j,i]``: Wall-clock time for the ``i`` test
  for the ``j`` label or subproject
* ``num_processors[j,i]``: Value of the CTest ``PROCESSORS`` property
  for the ``i`` test for the ``j`` label or subproject
* ``num_tests[j]``: Number of tests associated with the ``j`` label or subproject
* ``total``: Total number of labels or subprojects that have at least one test run

Therefore, the weighted time summary for each label or subproject represents
the amount of time that CTest gave to run the tests for each label or
subproject and gives a good representation of the total expense of the tests
for each label or subproject when compared to other labels or subprojects.

For example, if ``SubprojectA`` showed ``100 sec*proc`` and ``SubprojectB`` showed
``10 sec*proc``, then CTest allocated approximately 10 times the CPU/core time
to run the tests for ``SubprojectA`` than for ``SubprojectB`` (e.g. so if effort
is going to be expended to reduce the cost of the test suite for the whole
project, then reducing the cost of the test suite for ``SubprojectA`` would
likely have a larger impact than effort to reduce the cost of the test suite
for ``SubprojectB``).

Build and Test Mode
===================

CTest provides a command-line signature to configure (i.e. run cmake on),
build, and/or execute a test::

 ctest --build-and-test <path-to-source> <path-to-build>
       --build-generator <generator>
       [<options>...]
       [--build-options <opts>...]
       [--test-command <command> [<args>...]]

The configure and test steps are optional. The arguments to this command line
are the source and binary directories.  The ``--build-generator`` option *must*
be provided to use ``--build-and-test``.  If ``--test-command`` is specified
then that will be run after the build is complete.  Other options that affect
this mode include:

``--build-target``
 Specify a specific target to build.

 If left out the ``all`` target is built.

``--build-nocmake``
 Run the build without running cmake first.

 Skip the cmake step.

``--build-run-dir``
 Specify directory to run programs from.

 Directory where programs will be after it has been compiled.

``--build-two-config``
 Run CMake twice.

``--build-exe-dir``
 Specify the directory for the executable.

``--build-generator``
 Specify the generator to use. See the ``cmake-generators(7)`` manual.

``--build-generator-platform``
 Specify the generator-specific platform.

``--build-generator-toolset``
 Specify the generator-specific toolset.

``--build-project``
 Specify the name of the project to build.

``--build-makeprogram``
 Specify the explicit make program to be used by CMake when configuring and
 building the project. Only applicable for Make and Ninja based generators.

``--build-noclean``
 Skip the make clean step.

``--build-config-sample``
 A sample executable to use to determine the configuration that
 should be used.  e.g.  ``Debug``, ``Release`` etc.

``--build-options``
 Additional options for configuring the build (i.e. for CMake, not for
 the build tool).  Note that if this is specified, the ``--build-options``
 keyword and its arguments must be the last option given on the command
 line, with the possible exception of ``--test-command``.

``--test-command``
 The command to run as the test step with the ``--build-and-test`` option.
 All arguments following this keyword will be assumed to be part of the
 test command line, so it must be the last option given.

``--test-timeout``
 The time limit in seconds

Dashboard Client
================

CTest can operate as a client for the CDash software quality dashboard
application.  As a dashboard client, CTest performs a sequence of steps
to configure, build, and test software, and then submits the results to
a CDash server. The command-line signature used to submit to CDash is::

 ctest (-D <dashboard> | -M <model> -T <action> | -S <script> | -SP <script>)
       [-- <dashboard-options>...]

Options for Dashboard Client include:

``--group <group>``
 Specify what group you'd like to submit results to

 Submit dashboard to specified group instead of default one.  By
 default, the dashboard is submitted to Nightly, Experimental, or
 Continuous group, but by specifying this option, the group can be
 arbitrary.

 This replaces the deprecated option ``--track``.
 Despite the name change its behavior is unchanged.

``-A <file>, --add-notes <file>``
 Add a notes file with submission.

 This option tells CTest to include a notes file when submitting
 dashboard.

``--tomorrow-tag``
 ``Nightly`` or ``Experimental`` starts with next day tag.

 This is useful if the build will not finish in one day.

``--extra-submit <file>[;<file>]``
 Submit extra files to the dashboard.

 This option will submit extra files to the dashboard.

``--http1.0``
 Submit using `HTTP 1.0`.

 This option will force CTest to use `HTTP 1.0` to submit files to the
 dashboard, instead of `HTTP 1.1`.

``--no-compress-output``
 Do not compress test output when submitting.

 This flag will turn off automatic compression of test output.  Use
 this to maintain compatibility with an older version of CDash which
 doesn't support compressed test output.

Dashboard Client Steps
----------------------

CTest defines an ordered list of testing steps of which some or all may
be run as a dashboard client:

``Start``
  Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded
  by the following steps.
  See the CTest Start Step section below.

``Update``
  Update the source tree from its version control repository.
  Record the old and new versions and the list of updated source files.
  See the CTest Update Step section below.

``Configure``
  Configure the software by running a command in the build tree.
  Record the configuration output log.
  See the CTest Configure Step section below.

``Build``
  Build the software by running a command in the build tree.
  Record the build output log and detect warnings and errors.
  See the CTest Build Step section below.

``Test``
  Test the software by loading a ``CTestTestfile.cmake``
  from the build tree and executing the defined tests.
  Record the output and result of each test.
  See the CTest Test Step section below.

``Coverage``
  Compute coverage of the source code by running a coverage
  analysis tool and recording its output.
  See the CTest Coverage Step section below.

``MemCheck``
  Run the software test suite through a memory check tool.
  Record the test output, results, and issues reported by the tool.
  See the CTest MemCheck Step section below.

``Submit``
  Submit results recorded from other testing steps to the
  software quality dashboard server.
  See the CTest Submit Step section below.

Dashboard Client Modes
----------------------

CTest defines three modes of operation as a dashboard client:

``Nightly``
  This mode is intended to be invoked once per day, typically at night.
  It enables the ``Start``, ``Update``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``,
  ``Coverage``, and ``Submit`` steps by default.  Selected steps run even
  if the ``Update`` step reports no changes to the source tree.

``Continuous``
  This mode is intended to be invoked repeatedly throughout the day.
  It enables the ``Start``, ``Update``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``,
  ``Coverage``, and ``Submit`` steps by default, but exits after the
  ``Update`` step if it reports no changes to the source tree.

``Experimental``
  This mode is intended to be invoked by a developer to test local changes.
  It enables the ``Start``, ``Configure``, ``Build``, ``Test``, ``Coverage``,
  and ``Submit`` steps by default.

Dashboard Client via CTest Command-Line
---------------------------------------

CTest can perform testing on an already-generated build tree.
Run the ``ctest`` command with the current working directory set
to the build tree and use one of these signatures::

 ctest -D <mode>[<step>]
 ctest -M <mode> [ -T <step> ]...

The ``<mode>`` must be one of the above Dashboard Client Modes,
and each ``<step>`` must be one of the above Dashboard Client Steps.

CTest reads the Dashboard Client Configuration settings from
a file in the build tree called either ``CTestConfiguration.ini``
or ``DartConfiguration.tcl`` (the names are historical).  The format
of the file is::

 # Lines starting in '#' are comments.
 # Other non-blank lines are key-value pairs.
 <setting>: <value>

where ``<setting>`` is the setting name and ``<value>`` is the
setting value.

In build trees generated by CMake, this configuration file is
generated by the ``CTest`` module if included by the project.
The module uses variables to obtain a value for each setting
as documented with the settings below.

Dashboard Client via CTest Script
---------------------------------

CTest can perform testing driven by a ``cmake-language(7)``
script that creates and maintains the source and build tree as
well as performing the testing steps.  Run the ``ctest`` command
with the current working directory set outside of any build tree
and use one of these signatures::

 ctest -S <script>
 ctest -SP <script>

The ``<script>`` file must call :ref:`CTest Commands` commands
to run testing steps explicitly as documented below.  The commands
obtain Dashboard Client Configuration settings from their
arguments or from variables set in the script.

Dashboard Client Configuration
==============================

The Dashboard Client Steps may be configured by named
settings as documented in the following sections.

CTest Start Step
----------------

Start a new dashboard submission to be composed of results recorded
by the following steps.

In a CTest Script, the ``ctest_start()`` command runs this step.
Arguments to the command may specify some of the step settings.
The command first runs the command-line specified by the
``CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND`` variable, if set, to initialize the source
directory.

Configuration settings include:

``BuildDirectory``
  The full path to the project build tree.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY``
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``PROJECT_BINARY_DIR``

``SourceDirectory``
  The full path to the project source tree.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY``
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR``

CTest Update Step
-----------------

In a CTest Script, the ``ctest_update()`` command runs this step.

  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``GITCOMMAND``

  The source tree is updated by ``git fetch`` followed by
  ``git reset --hard`` to the ``FETCH_HEAD``.  The result is the same
  as ``git pull`` except that any local modifications are overwritten.
  Use ``GITUpdateCustom`` to specify a different approach.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_SVN_UPDATE_OPTIONS``
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``SVN_UPDATE_OPTIONS``

``UpdateCommand``
  Specify the version-control command-line tool to use without
  detecting the VCS that manages the source tree.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_UPDATE_COMMAND``
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``<VCS>COMMAND``

  tree if it cannot be detected automatically.
  The value may be ``bzr``, ``cvs``, ``git``, ``hg``,
  ``p4``, or ``svn``.

  * CTest Script variable: none, detected from source tree
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``UPDATE_TYPE`` if set,
    else ``CTEST_UPDATE_TYPE``

``UpdateVersionOnly``

  discover the current version that is checked out, and not to update
  to a different version.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_ONLY``

``UpdateVersionOverride``
  Specify the current version of your source tree.

  When this variable is set to a non-empty string, CTest will report the value
  you specified rather than using the update command to discover the current
  version that is checked out. Use of this variable supersedes
  ``UpdateVersionOnly``. Like ``UpdateVersionOnly``, using this variable tells
  CTest not to update the source tree to a different version.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_UPDATE_VERSION_OVERRIDE``

Additional configuration settings include:

``NightlyStartTime``
  In the ``Nightly`` dashboard mode, specify the "nightly start time".
  With centralized version control systems (``cvs`` and ``svn``),
  the ``Update`` step checks out the version of the software as of
  this time so that multiple clients choose a common version to test.
  This is not well-defined in distributed version-control systems so
  the setting is ignored.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME``
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``NIGHTLY_START_TIME`` if set,
    else ``CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME``

CTest Configure Step
--------------------

In a CTest Script, the ``ctest_configure()`` command runs this step.

  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``CMAKE_COMMAND``
    followed by ``PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR``

``LabelsForSubprojects``
  Specify a semicolon-separated list of labels that will be treated as
  subprojects. This mapping will be passed on to CDash when configure, test or
  build results are submitted.

  * CTest Script variable: ``CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS``
  * ``CTest`` module variable: ``CTEST_LABELS_FOR_SUBPROJECTS``

  See Label and Subproject Summary.

CTest Build Step
----------------

In a CTest Script, the ``ctest_build()`` command runs this step.
Arguments to the command may specify some of the step settings.

Configuration settings include:

``DefaultCTestConfigurationType``
  When the build system to be launched allows build-time selection
  of the configuration (e.g. ``Debug``, ``Release``), this specifies
  the default configuration to be built when no ``-C`` option is
  given to the ``ctest`` command.  The value will be substituted into
  the value of ``MakeCommand`` to replace the literal string
  ``${CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE}`` if it appears.

  :ref:`Makefile Generators` or the ``Ninja``
  generator, specify whether the
  ``CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS`` feature is enabled by the
  ``CTestUseLaunchers`` module (also included by the
  ``CTest`` module).  When enabled, the generated build
  system wraps each invocation of the compiler, linker, or
  custom command line with a "launcher" that communicates
  with CTest via environment variables and files to report
  granular build warning and error information.  Otherwise,
  CTest must "scrape" the build output log for diagnostics.

information is output in JSON format.  Version 1.0 of the JSON object
model is defined as follows:

``kind``
  The string "ctestInfo".

``version``
  A JSON object specifying the version components.  Its members are

  ``major``
    A non-negative integer specifying the major version component.
  ``minor``
    A non-negative integer specifying the minor version component.

``backtraceGraph``
    JSON object representing backtrace information with the
    following members:

    ``commands``
      List of command names.
    ``files``
      List of file names.
    ``nodes``
      List of node JSON objects with members:

      ``command``
        Index into the ``commands`` member of the ``backtraceGraph``.
      ``file``
        Index into the ``files`` member of the ``backtraceGraph``.
      ``line``
        Line number in the file where the backtrace was added.
      ``parent``
        Index into the ``nodes`` member of the ``backtraceGraph``
        representing the parent in the graph.

``tests``
  A JSON array listing information about each test.  Each entry
  is a JSON object with members:

  ``name``
    Test name.
  ``config``
    Configuration that the test can run on.
    Empty string means any config.
  ``command``
    List where the first element is the test command and the
    remaining elements are the command arguments.
  ``backtrace``
    Index into the ``nodes`` member of the ``backtraceGraph``.
  ``properties``
    Test properties.
    Can contain keys for each of the supported test properties.

Hardware Allocation
===================

CTest provides a mechanism for tests to specify the hardware that they need and
how much of it they need, and for users to specify the hardware availiable on
the running machine. This allows CTest to internally keep track of which
hardware is in use and which is free, scheduling tests in a way that prevents
them from trying to claim hardware that is not available.

A common use case for this feature is for tests that require the use of a GPU.
Multiple tests can simultaneously allocate memory from a GPU, but if too many
tests try to do this at once, some of them will fail to allocate, resulting in
a failed test, even though the test would have succeeded if it had the memory
it needed. By using the hardware allocation feature, each test can specify how
much memory it requires from a GPU, allowing CTest to schedule tests in a way
that running several of these tests at once does not exhaust the GPU's memory
pool.

Please note that CTest has no concept of what a GPU is or how much memory it
has, nor does it have any way of communicating with a GPU to retrieve this
information or perform any memory management. CTest simply keeps track of a
list of abstract resource types, each of which has a certain number of slots
available for tests to use. Each test specifies the number of slots that it
requires from a certain resource, and CTest then schedules them in a way that
prevents the total number of slots in use from exceeding the listed capacity.
When a test is executed, and slots from a resource are allocated to that test,
tests may assume that they have exclusive use of those slots for the duration
of the test's process.

The CTest hardware allocation feature consists of two inputs:

* The :ref:`hardware specification file <ctest-hardware-specification-file>`,
  described below, which describes the hardware resources available on the
  system, and
* The ``PROCESSES`` property of tests, which describes the resources
  required by the test

When CTest runs a test, the hardware allocated to that test is passed in the
form of a set of
:ref:`environment variables <ctest-hardware-environment-variables>` as
described below. Using this information to decide which resource to connect to
is left to the test writer.

Please note that these processes are not spawned by CTest. The ``PROCESSES``
property merely tells CTest what processes the test expects to launch. It is up
to the test itself to do this process spawning, and read the :ref:`environment
variables <ctest-hardware-environment-variables>` to determine which resources
each process has been allocated.

Hardware Specification File
---------------------------

The hardware specification file is a JSON file which is passed to CTest, either
on the ``ctest(1)`` command line as ``--hardware-spec-file``, or as the
``HARDWARE_SPEC_FILE`` argument of ``ctest_test()``. The hardware
specification file must be a JSON object. All examples in this document assume
the following hardware specification file:

 {
   "local": [
     {
       "gpus": [
         {
           "id": "0",
           "slots": 2
         },
         {
           "id": "1",
           "slots": 4
         },
         {
           "id": "2",
           "slots": 2
         },
         {
           "id": "3"
         }
       ],
       "crypto_chips": [
         {
           "id": "card0",
           "slots": 4
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
 }

The members are:

``local``
  A JSON array consisting of CPU sockets present on the system. Currently, only
  one socket is supported.

  Each socket is a JSON object with members whose names are equal to the
  desired resource types, such as ``gpu``. These names must start with a
  lowercase letter or an underscore, and subsequent characters can be a
  lowercase letter, a digit, or an underscore. Uppercase letters are not
  allowed, because certain platforms have case-insensitive environment
  variables. See the Environment Variables section below for
  more information. It is recommended that the resource type name be the plural
  of a noun, such as ``gpus`` or ``crypto_chips`` (and not ``gpu`` or
  ``crypto_chip``.)

  Please note that the names ``gpus`` and ``crypto_chips`` are just examples,
  and CTest does not interpret them in any way. You are free to make up any
  resource type you want to meet your own requirements.

  The value for each resource type is a JSON array consisting of JSON objects,
  each of which describe a specific instance of the specified resource. These
  objects have the following members:

  ``id``
    A string consisting of an identifier for the resource. Each character in
    the identifier can be a lowercase letter, a digit, or an underscore.
    Uppercase letters are not allowed.

    Identifiers must be unique within a resource type. However, they do not
    have to be unique across resource types. For example, it is valid to have a
    ``gpus`` resource named ``0`` and a ``crypto_chips`` resource named ``0``,
    but not two ``gpus`` resources both named ``0``.

    Please note that the IDs ``0``, ``1``, ``2``, ``3``, and ``card0`` are just
    examples, and CTest does not interpret them in any way. You are free to
    make up any IDs you want to meet your own requirements.

  ``slots``
    An optional unsigned number specifying the number of slots available on the
    resource. For example, this could be megabytes of RAM on a GPU, or
    cryptography units available on a cryptography chip. If ``slots`` is not
    specified, a default value of ``1`` is assumed.

In the example file above, there are four GPUs with ID's 0 through 3. GPU 0 has
2 slots, GPU 1 has 4, GPU 2 has 2, and GPU 3 has a default of 1 slot. There is
also one cryptography chip with 4 slots.

``PROCESSES`` Property
----------------------

See ``PROCESSES`` for a description of this property.

Environment Variables
---------------------

Once CTest has decided which resources to allocate to a test, it passes this

cpack(1)
********

Synopsis
========

 cpack [<options>]

Description
===========

The **cpack** executable is the CMake packaging program.  It generates
installers and source packages in a variety of formats.

For each installer or package format, **cpack** has a specific backend,
called "generator". A generator is responsible for generating the required
inputs and invoking the specific package creation tools. These installer
or package generators are not to be confused with the makefile generators
of the ``cmake`` command.

All supported generators are specified in the :manual:`cpack-generators
<cpack-generators(7)>` manual.  The command ``cpack --help`` prints a
list of generators supported for the target platform.  Which of them are
to be used can be selected through the ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` variable
or through the command-line option ``-G``.

The **cpack** program is steered by a configuration file written in the
``CMake language``. Unless chosen differently
through the command-line option ``--config``, the file ``CPackConfig.cmake``
in the current directory is used.

In the standard CMake workflow, the file ``CPackConfig.cmake`` is generated
by the ``cmake`` executable, provided the ``CPack``
module is included by the project's ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

Options
=======

``-G <generators>``
  ``<generators>`` is a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>`
  of generator names.  ``cpack`` will iterate through this list and produce
  package(s) in that generator's format according to the details provided in
  the ``CPackConfig.cmake`` configuration file.  If this option is not given,
  the ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` variable determines the default set of
  generators that will be used.

``-C <configs>``
  Specify the project configuration(s) to be packaged (e.g. ``Debug``,
  ``Release``, etc.), where ``<configs>`` is a
  :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>`.
  When the CMake project uses a multi-configuration
  generator such as Xcode or Visual Studio, this option is needed to tell
  ``cpack`` which built executables to include in the package.

``-D <var>=<value>``
  Set a CPack variable.  This will override any value set for ``<var>`` in the
  input file read by ``cpack``.

``--config <configFile>``
  Specify the configuration file read by ``cpack`` to provide the packaging
  details.  By default, ``CPackConfig.cmake`` in the current directory will
  be used.

``--verbose, -V``
  Run ``cpack`` with verbose output.  This can be used to show more details
  from the package generation tools and is suitable for project developers.

``--debug``
  Run ``cpack`` with debug output.  This option is intended mainly for the
  developers of ``cpack`` itself and is not normally needed by project
  developers.

``--trace``
  Put the underlying cmake scripts in trace mode.

``--trace-expand``
  Put the underlying cmake scripts in expanded trace mode.

``-P <packageName>``
  Override/define the value of the ``CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME`` variable used
  for packaging.  Any value set for this variable in the ``CPackConfig.cmake``
  file will then be ignored.

``-R <packageVersion>``
  Override/define the value of the ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION``
  variable used for packaging.  It will override a value set in the
  ``CPackConfig.cmake`` file or one automatically computed from
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR``,
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR`` and
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH``.

``-B <packageDirectory>``
  Override/define ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY``, which controls the
  directory where CPack will perform its packaging work.  The resultant
  package(s) will be created at this location by default and a
  ``_CPack_Packages`` subdirectory will also be created below this directory to
  use as a working area during package creation.

``--vendor <vendorName>``
  Override/define ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR``.

 ccmake [<options>] {<path-to-source> | <path-to-existing-build>}

Description
===========

The **ccmake** executable is the CMake curses interface.  Project
configuration settings may be specified interactively through this
GUI.  Brief instructions are provided at the bottom of the terminal
when the program is running.

CMake is a cross-platform build system generator.  Projects specify
their build process with platform-independent CMake listfiles included
in each directory of a source tree with the name ``CMakeLists.txt``.
Users build a project by using CMake to generate a build system for a
native tool on their platform.

Options
=======

``-S <path-to-source>``
 Path to root directory of the CMake project to build.

``-B <path-to-build>``
 Path to directory which CMake will use as the root of build directory.

 If the directory doesn't already exist CMake will make it.

``-C <initial-cache>``
 Pre-load a script to populate the cache.

 When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
 ``CMakeCache.txt`` file and populates it with customizable settings for
 the project.  This option may be used to specify a file from which
 to load cache entries before the first pass through the project's
 CMake listfiles.  The loaded entries take priority over the
 project's default values.  The given file should be a CMake script
 containing ``set()`` commands that use the ``CACHE`` option, not a
 cache-format file.

 References to ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``
 within the script evaluate to the top-level source and build tree.

``-D <var>:<type>=<value>, -D <var>=<value>``
 Create or update a CMake ``CACHE`` entry.

 When CMake is first run in an empty build tree, it creates a
 ``CMakeCache.txt`` file and populates it with customizable settings for
 the project.  This option may be used to specify a setting that
 takes priority over the project's default value.  The option may be
 repeated for as many ``CACHE`` entries as desired.

 If the ``:<type>`` portion is given it must be one of the types
 specified by the ``set()`` command documentation for its
 ``CACHE`` signature.
 If the ``:<type>`` portion is omitted the entry will be created
 with no type if it does not exist with a type already.  If a
 command in the project sets the type to ``PATH`` or ``FILEPATH``
 then the ``<value>`` will be converted to an absolute path.

 This option may also be given as a single argument:
 ``-D<var>:<type>=<value>`` or ``-D<var>=<value>``.

``-U <globbing_expr>``
 Remove matching entries from CMake ``CACHE``.

 This option may be used to remove one or more variables from the
 ``CMakeCache.txt`` file, globbing expressions using ``*`` and ``?`` are
 supported.  The option may be repeated for as many ``CACHE`` entries as
 desired.

 Use with care, you can make your ``CMakeCache.txt`` non-working.

``-G <generator-name>``
 Specify a build system generator.

 CMake may support multiple native build systems on certain
 platforms.  A generator is responsible for generating a particular
 build system.  Possible generator names are specified in the
 ``cmake-generators(7)`` manual.

 If not specified, CMake checks the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` environment
 variable and otherwise falls back to a builtin default selection.

``-T <toolset-spec>``
 Toolset specification for the generator, if supported.

 Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell
 the native build system how to choose a compiler.  See the
 ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

``-A <platform-name>``
 Specify platform name if supported by generator.

 Some CMake generators support a platform name to be given to the
 native build system to choose a compiler or SDK.  See the
 ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable for details.

``-Wno-dev``
 Suppress developer warnings.

 Suppress warnings that are meant for the author of the
 ``CMakeLists.txt`` files. By default this will also turn off
 deprecation warnings.

``-Wdev``
 Enable developer warnings.

 Enable warnings that are meant for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt``
 files. By default this will also turn on deprecation warnings.

``-Werror=dev``
 Make developer warnings errors.

 Make warnings that are meant for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files
 errors. By default this will also turn on deprecated warnings as errors.

``-Wno-error=dev``
 Make developer warnings not errors.

 Make warnings that are meant for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files not
 errors. By default this will also turn off deprecated warnings as errors.

``-Wdeprecated``
 Enable deprecated functionality warnings.

 Enable warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

``-Wno-deprecated``
 Suppress deprecated functionality warnings.

 Suppress warnings for usage of deprecated functionality, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

``-Werror=deprecated``
 Make deprecated macro and function warnings errors.

 Make warnings for usage of deprecated macros and functions, that are meant
 for the author of the ``CMakeLists.txt`` files, errors.

``-Wno-error=deprecated``

Reference Manuals

cmake-buildsystem(7)
********************

Introduction
============

A CMake-based buildsystem is organized as a set of high-level logical
targets.  Each target corresponds to an executable or library, or
is a custom target containing custom commands.  Dependencies between the
targets are expressed in the buildsystem to determine the build order
and the rules for regeneration in response to change.

Binary Targets
==============

Executables and libraries are defined using the ``add_executable()``
and ``add_library()`` commands.  The resulting binary files have
appropriate ``PREFIX``, ``SUFFIX`` and extensions for the platform targeted.
Dependencies between binary targets are expressed using the
``target_link_libraries()`` command:

 add_library(archive archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)
 add_executable(zipapp zipapp.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(zipapp archive)

``archive`` is defined as a ``STATIC`` library -- an archive containing objects
compiled from ``archive.cpp``, ``zip.cpp``, and ``lzma.cpp``.  ``zipapp``
is defined as an executable formed by compiling and linking ``zipapp.cpp``.
When linking the ``zipapp`` executable, the ``archive`` static library is
linked in.

Binary Executables
------------------

The ``add_executable()`` command defines an executable target:

 add_executable(mytool mytool.cpp)

Commands such as ``add_custom_command()``, which generates rules to be
run at build time can transparently use an ``EXECUTABLE``
target as a ``COMMAND`` executable.  The buildsystem rules will ensure that
the executable is built before attempting to run the command.

Binary Library Types
--------------------

Normal Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default, the ``add_library()`` command defines a ``STATIC`` library,
unless a type is specified.  A type may be specified when using the command:

 add_library(archive SHARED archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

 add_library(archive STATIC archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

The ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` variable may be enabled to change the
behavior of ``add_library()`` to build shared libraries by default.

In the context of the buildsystem definition as a whole, it is largely
irrelevant whether particular libraries are ``SHARED`` or ``STATIC`` --
the commands, dependency specifications and other APIs work similarly
regardless of the library type.  The ``MODULE`` library type is
dissimilar in that it is generally not linked to -- it is not used in
the right-hand-side of the ``target_link_libraries()`` command.
It is a type which is loaded as a plugin using runtime techniques.
If the library does not export any unmanaged symbols (e.g. Windows
resource DLL, C++/CLI DLL), it is required that the library not be a
``SHARED`` library because CMake expects ``SHARED`` libraries to export
at least one symbol.

 add_library(archive MODULE 7z.cpp)

Apple Frameworks
""""""""""""""""

A ``SHARED`` library may be marked with the ``FRAMEWORK``
target property to create an macOS or iOS Framework Bundle.
The ``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER`` sets ``CFBundleIdentifier`` key
and it uniquely identifies the bundle.

 add_library(MyFramework SHARED MyFramework.cpp)
 set_target_properties(MyFramework PROPERTIES
   FRAMEWORK TRUE
   FRAMEWORK_VERSION A
   MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER org.cmake.MyFramework
 )

Object Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``OBJECT`` library type defines a non-archival collection of object files
resulting from compiling the given source files.  The object files collection
may be used as source inputs to other targets:

 add_library(archive OBJECT archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

 add_library(archiveExtras STATIC $<TARGET_OBJECTS:archive> extras.cpp)

 add_executable(test_exe $<TARGET_OBJECTS:archive> test.cpp)

The link (or archiving) step of those other targets will use the object
files collection in addition to those from their own sources.

Alternatively, object libraries may be linked into other targets:

 add_library(archive OBJECT archive.cpp zip.cpp lzma.cpp)

 add_library(archiveExtras STATIC extras.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(archiveExtras PUBLIC archive)

 add_executable(test_exe test.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(test_exe archive)

The link (or archiving) step of those other targets will use the object
files from ``OBJECT`` libraries that are *directly* linked.  Additionally,
usage requirements of the ``OBJECT`` libraries will be honored when compiling
sources in those other targets.  Furthermore, those usage requirements
will propagate transitively to dependents of those other targets.

Object libraries may not be used as the ``TARGET`` in a use of the
``add_custom_command(TARGET)`` command signature.  However,
the list of objects can be used by ``add_custom_command(OUTPUT)``
or ``file(GENERATE)`` by using ``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>``.

Build Specification and Usage Requirements
==========================================

The ``target_include_directories()``, ``target_compile_definitions()``
and ``target_compile_options()`` commands specify the build specifications
and the usage requirements of binary targets.  The commands populate the
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` target properties respectively, and/or the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
and ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` target properties.

Each of the commands has a ``PRIVATE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` mode.  The
``PRIVATE`` mode populates only the non-``INTERFACE_`` variant of the target
property and the ``INTERFACE`` mode populates only the ``INTERFACE_`` variants.
The ``PUBLIC`` mode populates both variants of the respective target property.
Each command may be invoked with multiple uses of each keyword:

 target_compile_definitions(archive
   PRIVATE BUILDING_WITH_LZMA
   INTERFACE USING_ARCHIVE_LIB
 )

Note that usage requirements are not designed as a way to make downstreams
use particular ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` or
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` etc for convenience only.  The contents of
the properties must be **requirements**, not merely recommendations or
convenience.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

Target Properties
-----------------

The contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` target
properties are used appropriately when compiling the source files of a
binary target.

Entries in the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` are added to the compile line
with ``-I`` or ``-isystem`` prefixes and in the order of appearance in the
property value.

Entries in the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` are prefixed with ``-D`` or
``/D`` and added to the compile line in an unspecified order.  The
``DEFINE_SYMBOL`` target property is also added as a compile
definition as a special convenience case for ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE``
library targets.

Entries in the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` are escaped for the shell and added
in the order of appearance in the property value.  Several compile options have
special separate handling, such as ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``.

The contents of the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` target properties are
*Usage Requirements* -- they specify content which consumers
must use to correctly compile and link with the target they appear on.
For any binary target, the contents of each ``INTERFACE_`` property on
each target specified in a ``target_link_libraries()`` command is
consumed:

 set(srcs archive.cpp zip.cpp)
 if (LZMA_FOUND)
   list(APPEND srcs lzma.cpp)
 endif()
 add_library(archive SHARED ${srcs})
 if (LZMA_FOUND)
   # The archive library sources are compiled with -DBUILDING_WITH_LZMA
   target_compile_definitions(archive PRIVATE BUILDING_WITH_LZMA)
 endif()
 target_compile_definitions(archive INTERFACE USING_ARCHIVE_LIB)

 add_executable(consumer)
 # Link consumer to archive and consume its usage requirements. The consumer
 # executable sources are compiled with -DUSING_ARCHIVE_LIB.
 target_link_libraries(consumer archive)

Because it is common to require that the source directory and corresponding
build directory are added to the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, the
``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR`` variable can be enabled to conveniently
add the corresponding directories to the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of
all targets.  The variable ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE``
can be enabled to add the corresponding directories to the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of all targets.  This makes use of
targets in multiple different directories convenient through use of the
``target_link_libraries()`` command.


Transitive Usage Requirements
-----------------------------

The usage requirements of a target can transitively propagate to dependents.
The ``target_link_libraries()`` command has ``PRIVATE``,
``INTERFACE`` and ``PUBLIC`` keywords to control the propagation.

 add_library(archive archive.cpp)
 target_compile_definitions(archive INTERFACE USING_ARCHIVE_LIB)

 add_library(serialization serialization.cpp)
 target_compile_definitions(serialization INTERFACE USING_SERIALIZATION_LIB)

 add_library(archiveExtras extras.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(archiveExtras PUBLIC archive)
 target_link_libraries(archiveExtras PRIVATE serialization)
 # archiveExtras is compiled with -DUSING_ARCHIVE_LIB
 # and -DUSING_SERIALIZATION_LIB

 add_executable(consumer consumer.cpp)
 # consumer is compiled with -DUSING_ARCHIVE_LIB
 target_link_libraries(consumer archiveExtras)

Because ``archive`` is a ``PUBLIC`` dependency of ``archiveExtras``, the
usage requirements of it are propagated to ``consumer`` too.  Because
``serialization`` is a ``PRIVATE`` dependency of ``archiveExtras``, the usage
requirements of it are not propagated to ``consumer``.

Generally, a dependency should be specified in a use of
``target_link_libraries()`` with the ``PRIVATE`` keyword if it is used by
only the implementation of a library, and not in the header files.  If a
dependency is additionally used in the header files of a library (e.g. for
class inheritance), then it should be specified as a ``PUBLIC`` dependency.
A dependency which is not used by the implementation of a library, but only by
its headers should be specified as an ``INTERFACE`` dependency.  The
``target_link_libraries()`` command may be invoked with multiple uses of
each keyword:

 target_link_libraries(archiveExtras
   PUBLIC archive
   PRIVATE serialization
 )

Usage requirements are propagated by reading the ``INTERFACE_`` variants
of target properties from dependencies and appending the values to the
non-``INTERFACE_`` variants of the operand.  For example, the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of dependencies is read and
appended to the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of the operand.  In cases
where order is relevant and maintained, and the order resulting from the
``target_link_libraries()`` calls does not allow correct compilation,
use of an appropriate command to set the property directly may update the
order.

For example, if the linked libraries for a target must be specified
in the order ``lib1`` ``lib2`` ``lib3`` , but the include directories must
be specified in the order ``lib3`` ``lib1`` ``lib2``:

 target_link_libraries(myExe lib1 lib2 lib3)
 target_include_directories(myExe
   PRIVATE $<TARGET_PROPERTY:lib3,INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>)

Note that care must be taken when specifying usage requirements for targets
which will be exported for installation using the ``install(EXPORT)``
command.  See :ref:`Creating Packages` for more.

Compatible Interface Properties
-------------------------------

Some target properties are required to be compatible between a target and
the interface of each dependency.  For example, the
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target property may specify a
boolean value of whether a target should be compiled as
position-independent-code, which has platform-specific consequences.
A target may also specify the usage requirement
``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` to communicate that
consumers must be compiled as position-independent-code.

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET exe1 PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

 add_library(lib1 SHARED lib1.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

 add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1)

Here, both ``exe1`` and ``exe2`` will be compiled as position-independent-code.
``lib1`` will also be compiled as position-independent-code because that is the
default setting for ``SHARED`` libraries.  If dependencies have conflicting,
non-compatible requirements ``cmake(1)`` issues a diagnostic:

 add_library(lib1 SHARED lib1.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

 add_library(lib2 SHARED lib2.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF)

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1)
 set_property(TARGET exe1 PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF)

 add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1 lib2)

The ``lib1`` requirement ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` is not
"compatible" with the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property of
the ``exe1`` target.  The library requires that consumers are built as
position-independent-code, while the executable specifies to not built as
position-independent-code, so a diagnostic is issued.

The ``lib1`` and ``lib2`` requirements are not "compatible".  One of them
requires that consumers are built as position-independent-code, while
the other requires that consumers are not built as position-independent-code.
Because ``exe2`` links to both and they are in conflict, a diagnostic is
issued.

To be "compatible", the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property,
if set must be either the same, in a boolean sense, as the
``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property of all transitively
specified dependencies on which that property is set.

This property of "compatible interface requirement" may be extended to other
properties by specifying the property in the content of the
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` target property.  Each specified property
must be compatible between the consuming target and the corresponding property
with an ``INTERFACE_`` prefix from each dependency:

 add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CUSTOM_PROP ON)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL CUSTOM_PROP
 )

 add_library(lib1Version3 SHARED lib1_v3.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CUSTOM_PROP OFF)

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2) # CUSTOM_PROP will be ON

 add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1Version2 lib1Version3) # Diagnostic

Non-boolean properties may also participate in "compatible interface"
computations.  Properties specified in the
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING``
property must be either unspecified or compare to the same string among
all transitively specified dependencies. This can be useful to ensure
that multiple incompatible versions of a library are not linked together
through transitive requirements of a target:

 add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_LIB_VERSION 2)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING LIB_VERSION
 )

 add_library(lib1Version3 SHARED lib1_v3.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_LIB_VERSION 3)

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2) # LIB_VERSION will be "2"

 add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1Version2 lib1Version3) # Diagnostic

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX`` target property specifies
that content will be evaluated numerically and the maximum number among all
specified will be calculated:

 add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED 200)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED
 )

 add_library(lib1Version3 SHARED lib1_v3.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED 1000)

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 # CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED will be "200"
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2)

 add_executable(exe2 exe2.cpp)
 # CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED will be "1000"
 target_link_libraries(exe2 lib1Version2 lib1Version3)

Similarly, the ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`` may be used to
calculate the numeric minimum value for a property from dependencies.

Each calculated "compatible" property value may be read in the consumer at
generate-time using generator expressions.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in each
compatible interface property must not intersect with the set specified in
any of the other properties.

Property Origin Debugging
-------------------------

Because build specifications can be determined by dependencies, the lack of
locality of code which creates a target and code which is responsible for
setting build specifications may make the code more difficult to reason about.
``cmake(1)`` provides a debugging facility to print the origin of the
contents of properties which may be determined by dependencies.  The properties
which can be debugged are listed in the
``CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES`` variable documentation:

 set(CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
   INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
   POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
   CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED
   LIB_VERSION
 )
 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)

In the case of properties listed in ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` or
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING``, the debug output shows which target
was responsible for setting the property, and which other dependencies also
defined the property.  In the case of
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX`` and
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN``, the debug output shows the
value of the property from each dependency, and whether the value determines
the new extreme.

Build Specification with Generator Expressions
----------------------------------------------

Build specifications may use
``generator expressions`` containing
content which may be conditional or known only at generate-time.  For example,
the calculated "compatible" value of a property may be read with the
``TARGET_PROPERTY`` expression:

 add_library(lib1Version2 SHARED lib1_v2.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 PROPERTY
   INTERFACE_CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED 200)
 set_property(TARGET lib1Version2 APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED
 )

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1Version2)
 target_compile_definitions(exe1 PRIVATE
     CONTAINER_SIZE=$<TARGET_PROPERTY:CONTAINER_SIZE_REQUIRED>
 )

In this case, the ``exe1`` source files will be compiled with
``-DCONTAINER_SIZE=200``.

Configuration determined build specifications may be conveniently set using
the ``CONFIG`` generator expression.

 target_compile_definitions(exe1 PRIVATE
     $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_BUILD>
 )

The ``CONFIG`` parameter is compared case-insensitively with the configuration
being built.  In the presence of ``IMPORTED`` targets, the content of
``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_DEBUG`` is also
accounted for by this expression.

Some buildsystems generated by ``cmake(1)`` have a predetermined
build-configuration set in the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` variable.  The
buildsystem for the IDEs such as Visual Studio and Xcode are generated
independent of the build-configuration, and the actual build configuration
is not known until build-time.  Therefore, code such as

 string(TOLOWER ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE} _type)
 if (_type STREQUAL debug)
   target_compile_definitions(exe1 PRIVATE DEBUG_BUILD)
 endif()

may appear to work for :ref:`Makefile Generators` and ``Ninja``
generators, but is not portable to IDE generators.  Additionally,
the ``IMPORTED`` configuration-mappings are not accounted for
with code like this, so it should be avoided.

The unary ``TARGET_PROPERTY`` generator expression and the ``TARGET_POLICY``
generator expression are evaluated with the consuming target context.  This
means that a usage requirement specification may be evaluated differently based
on the consumer:

 add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
 target_compile_definitions(lib1 INTERFACE
   $<$<STREQUAL:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:TYPE>,EXECUTABLE>:LIB1_WITH_EXE>
   $<$<STREQUAL:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:TYPE>,SHARED_LIBRARY>:LIB1_WITH_SHARED_LIB>
   $<$<TARGET_POLICY:CMP0041>:CONSUMER_CMP0041_NEW>
 )

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1)

 cmake_policy(SET CMP0041 NEW)

 add_library(shared_lib shared_lib.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(shared_lib lib1)

The ``exe1`` executable will be compiled with ``-DLIB1_WITH_EXE``, while the
``shared_lib`` shared library will be compiled with ``-DLIB1_WITH_SHARED_LIB``
and ``-DCONSUMER_CMP0041_NEW``, because policy ``CMP0041`` is
``NEW`` at the point where the ``shared_lib`` target is created.

The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` expression wraps requirements which are only used when
consumed from a target in the same buildsystem, or when consumed from a target
exported to the build directory using the ``export()`` command.  The
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression wraps requirements which are only used when
consumed from a target which has been installed and exported with the
``install(EXPORT)`` command:

 add_library(ClimbingStats climbingstats.cpp)
 target_compile_definitions(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:ClimbingStats_FROM_BUILD_LOCATION>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:ClimbingStats_FROM_INSTALLED_LOCATION>
 )
 install(TARGETS ClimbingStats EXPORT libExport ${InstallArgs})
 install(EXPORT libExport NAMESPACE Upstream::
         DESTINATION lib/cmake/ClimbingStats)
 export(EXPORT libExport NAMESPACE Upstream::)

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 ClimbingStats)

In this case, the ``exe1`` executable will be compiled with
``-DClimbingStats_FROM_BUILD_LOCATION``.  The exporting commands generate
``IMPORTED`` targets with either the ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` or the
``BUILD_INTERFACE`` omitted, and the ``*_INTERFACE`` marker stripped away.
A separate project consuming the ``ClimbingStats`` package would contain:

 find_package(ClimbingStats REQUIRED)

 add_executable(Downstream main.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(Downstream Upstream::ClimbingStats)

Depending on whether the ``ClimbingStats`` package was used from the build
location or the install location, the ``Downstream`` target would be compiled
with either ``-DClimbingStats_FROM_BUILD_LOCATION`` or
``-DClimbingStats_FROM_INSTALL_LOCATION``.  For more about packages and
exporting see the ``cmake-packages(7)`` manual.

Include Directories and Usage Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Include directories require some special consideration when specified as usage
requirements and when used with generator expressions.  The
``target_include_directories()`` command accepts both relative and
absolute include directories:

 add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
 target_include_directories(lib1 PRIVATE
   /absolute/path
   relative/path
 )

Relative paths are interpreted relative to the source directory where the
command appears.  Relative paths are not allowed in the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of ``IMPORTED`` targets.

In cases where a non-trivial generator expression is used, the
``INSTALL_PREFIX`` expression may be used within the argument of an
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression.  It is a replacement marker which
expands to the installation prefix when imported by a consuming project.

Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

 add_library(ClimbingStats climbingstats.cpp)
 target_include_directories(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/generated>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:/absolute/path>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:relative/path>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:$<INSTALL_PREFIX>/$<CONFIG>/generated>
 )

Two convenience APIs are provided relating to include directories usage
requirements.  The ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE`` variable
may be enabled, with an equivalent effect to:

 set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR};${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}>
 )

for each target affected.  The convenience for installed targets is
an ``INCLUDES DESTINATION`` component with the ``install(TARGETS)``
command:

 install(TARGETS foo bar bat EXPORT tgts ${dest_args}
   INCLUDES DESTINATION include
 )
 install(EXPORT tgts ${other_args})
 install(FILES ${headers} DESTINATION include)

This is equivalent to appending ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include`` to the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of each of the installed
``IMPORTED`` targets when generated by ``install(EXPORT)``.

When the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of an
:ref:`imported target <Imported targets>` is consumed, the entries in the
property are treated as ``SYSTEM`` include directories, as if they were
listed in the ``INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of the
dependency. This can result in omission of compiler warnings for headers
found in those directories.  This behavior for :ref:`imported targets` may
be controlled by setting the ``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED`` target
property on the *consumers* of imported targets.

If a binary target is linked transitively to a macOS ``FRAMEWORK``, the
``Headers`` directory of the framework is also treated as a usage requirement.
This has the same effect as passing the framework directory as an include
directory.

Link Libraries and Generator Expressions
----------------------------------------

Like build specifications, ``link libraries`` may be
specified with generator expression conditions.  However, as consumption of
usage requirements is based on collection from linked dependencies, there is
an additional limitation that the link dependencies must form a "directed
acyclic graph".  That is, if linking to a target is dependent on the value of
a target property, that target property may not be dependent on the linked
dependencies:

 add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
 add_library(lib2 lib2.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(lib1 PUBLIC
   $<$<TARGET_PROPERTY:POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE>:lib2>
 )
 add_library(lib3 lib3.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET lib3 PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 lib1 lib3)

As the value of the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property of
the ``exe1`` target is dependent on the linked libraries (``lib3``), and the
edge of linking ``exe1`` is determined by the same
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property, the dependency graph above
contains a cycle.  ``cmake(1)`` issues a diagnostic in this case.

Output Artifacts
----------------

The buildsystem targets created by the ``add_library()`` and
``add_executable()`` commands create rules to create binary outputs.
The exact output location of the binaries can only be determined at
generate-time because it can depend on the build-configuration and the
link-language of linked dependencies etc.  ``TARGET_FILE``,
``TARGET_LINKER_FILE`` and related expressions can be used to access the
name and location of generated binaries.  These expressions do not work
for ``OBJECT`` libraries however, as there is no single file generated
by such libraries which is relevant to the expressions.

There are three kinds of output artifacts that may be build by targets
as detailed in the following sections.  Their classification differs
between DLL platforms and non-DLL platforms.  All Windows-based
systems including Cygwin are DLL platforms.

Runtime Output Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *runtime* output artifact of a buildsystem target may be:

* The executable file (e.g. ``.exe``) of an executable target
  created by the ``add_executable()`` command.

* On DLL platforms: the executable file (e.g. ``.dll``) of a shared
  library target created by the ``add_library()`` command
  with the ``SHARED`` option.

The ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` and ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME``
target properties may be used to control runtime output artifact locations
and names in the build tree.

Library Output Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *library* output artifact of a buildsystem target may be:

* The loadable module file (e.g. ``.dll`` or ``.so``) of a module
  library target created by the ``add_library()`` command
  with the ``MODULE`` option.

* On non-DLL platforms: the shared library file (e.g. ``.so`` or ``.dylib``)
  of a shared library target created by the ``add_library()``
  command with the ``SHARED`` option.

The ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` and ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME``
target properties may be used to control library output artifact locations
and names in the build tree.

Archive Output Artifacts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *archive* output artifact of a buildsystem target may be:

* The static library file (e.g. ``.lib`` or ``.a``) of a static
  library target created by the ``add_library()`` command
  with the ``STATIC`` option.

* On DLL platforms: the import library file (e.g. ``.lib``) of a shared
  library target created by the ``add_library()`` command
  with the ``SHARED`` option.  This file is only guaranteed to exist if
  the library exports at least one unmanaged symbol.

* On DLL platforms: the import library file (e.g. ``.lib``) of an
  executable target created by the ``add_executable()`` command
  when its ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property is set.

* On AIX: the linker import file (e.g. ``.imp``) of an executable target
  created by the ``add_executable()`` command when its
  ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property is set.

The ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` and ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME``
target properties may be used to control archive output artifact locations
and names in the build tree.

Directory-Scoped Commands
-------------------------

The ``target_include_directories()``,
``target_compile_definitions()`` and
``target_compile_options()`` commands have an effect on only one
target at a time.  The commands ``add_compile_definitions()``,
``add_compile_options()`` and ``include_directories()`` have
a similar function, but operate at directory scope instead of target
scope for convenience.

Pseudo Targets
==============

Some target types do not represent outputs of the buildsystem, but only inputs
such as external dependencies, aliases or other non-build artifacts.  Pseudo
targets are not represented in the generated buildsystem.

Imported Targets
----------------

An ``IMPORTED`` target represents a pre-existing dependency.  Usually
such targets are defined by an upstream package and should be treated as
immutable. After declaring an ``IMPORTED`` target one can adjust its
target properties by using the customary commands such as
``target_compile_definitions()``, ``target_include_directories()``,
``target_compile_options()`` or ``target_link_libraries()`` just like
with any other regular target.

``IMPORTED`` targets may have the same usage requirement properties
populated as binary targets, such as
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``,
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS``,
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``, and
``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``.

The ``LOCATION`` may also be read from an IMPORTED target, though there
is rarely reason to do so.  Commands such as ``add_custom_command()`` can
transparently use an ``IMPORTED`` ``EXECUTABLE`` target
as a ``COMMAND`` executable.

The scope of the definition of an ``IMPORTED`` target is the directory
where it was defined.  It may be accessed and used from subdirectories, but
not from parent directories or sibling directories.  The scope is similar to
the scope of a cmake variable.

It is also possible to define a ``GLOBAL`` ``IMPORTED`` target which is
accessible globally in the buildsystem.

See the ``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for more on creating packages
with ``IMPORTED`` targets.

Alias Targets
-------------

An ``ALIAS`` target is a name which may be used interchangeably with
a binary target name in read-only contexts.  A primary use-case for ``ALIAS``
targets is for example or unit test executables accompanying a library, which
may be part of the same buildsystem or built separately based on user
configuration.

 add_library(lib1 lib1.cpp)
 install(TARGETS lib1 EXPORT lib1Export ${dest_args})
 install(EXPORT lib1Export NAMESPACE Upstream:: ${other_args})

 add_library(Upstream::lib1 ALIAS lib1)

In another directory, we can link unconditionally to the ``Upstream::lib1``
target, which may be an ``IMPORTED`` target from a package, or an
``ALIAS`` target if built as part of the same buildsystem.

 if (NOT TARGET Upstream::lib1)
   find_package(lib1 REQUIRED)
 endif()
 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 Upstream::lib1)

``ALIAS`` targets are not mutable, installable or exportable.  They are
entirely local to the buildsystem description.  A name can be tested for
whether it is an ``ALIAS`` name by reading the ``ALIASED_TARGET``
property from it:

 get_target_property(_aliased Upstream::lib1 ALIASED_TARGET)
 if(_aliased)
   message(STATUS "The name Upstream::lib1 is an ALIAS for ${_aliased}.")
 endif()

Interface Libraries
-------------------

An ``INTERFACE`` target has no ``LOCATION`` and is mutable, but is
otherwise similar to an ``IMPORTED`` target.

It may specify usage requirements such as
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``,
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS``,
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``,
``INTERFACE_SOURCES``,
and ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``.
Only the ``INTERFACE`` modes of the ``target_include_directories()``,
``target_compile_definitions()``, ``target_compile_options()``,
``target_sources()``, and ``target_link_libraries()`` commands
may be used with ``INTERFACE`` libraries.

A primary use-case for ``INTERFACE`` libraries is header-only libraries.

 add_library(Eigen INTERFACE)
 target_include_directories(Eigen INTERFACE
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/Eigen>
 )

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 Eigen)

Here, the usage requirements from the ``Eigen`` target are consumed and used
when compiling, but it has no effect on linking.

Another use-case is to employ an entirely target-focussed design for usage
requirements:

 add_library(pic_on INTERFACE)
 set_property(TARGET pic_on PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE ON)
 add_library(pic_off INTERFACE)
 set_property(TARGET pic_off PROPERTY INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE OFF)

 add_library(enable_rtti INTERFACE)
 target_compile_options(enable_rtti INTERFACE
   $<$<OR:$<COMPILER_ID:GNU>,$<COMPILER_ID:Clang>>:-rtti>
 )

 add_executable(exe1 exe1.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(exe1 pic_on enable_rtti)

This way, the build specification of ``exe1`` is expressed entirely as linked
targets, and the complexity of compiler-specific flags is encapsulated in an
``INTERFACE`` library target.

The properties permitted to be set on or read from an ``INTERFACE`` library
are:

* Properties matching ``INTERFACE_*``
* Built-in properties matching ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_*``
* ``EXPORT_NAME``
* ``EXPORT_PROPERTIES``
* ``IMPORTED``
* ``MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES``
* ``NAME``
* Properties matching ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME_*``
* Properties matching ``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_*``

``INTERFACE`` libraries may be installed and exported.  Any content they refer
to must be installed separately:

 add_library(Eigen INTERFACE)
 target_include_directories(Eigen INTERFACE
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/Eigen>
 )

 install(TARGETS Eigen EXPORT eigenExport)
 install(EXPORT eigenExport NAMESPACE Upstream::
   DESTINATION lib/cmake/Eigen
 )
 install(FILES
     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/eigen.h
     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/vector.h
     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/matrix.h
   DESTINATION include/Eigen
 )

cmake_minimum_required
----------------------

Require a minimum version of cmake.

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <min>[...<max>] [FATAL_ERROR])

Sets the minimum required version of cmake for a project.
Also updates the policy settings as explained below.

``<min>`` and the optional ``<max>`` are each CMake versions of the form
``major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]``, and the ``...`` is literal.

If the running version of CMake is lower than the ``<min>`` required
version it will stop processing the project and report an error.
The optional ``<max>`` version, if specified, must be at least the
``<min>`` version and affects policy settings as described below.
If the running version of CMake is older than 3.12, the extra ``...``
dots will be seen as version component separators, resulting in the
``...<max>`` part being ignored and preserving the pre-3.12 behavior
of basing policies on ``<min>``.

The ``FATAL_ERROR`` option is accepted but ignored by CMake 2.6 and
higher.  It should be specified so CMake versions 2.4 and lower fail
with an error instead of just a warning.

.. note::
  Call the ``cmake_minimum_required()`` command at the beginning of
  the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file even before calling the
  ``project()`` command.  It is important to establish version
  and policy settings before invoking other commands whose behavior
  they may affect.  See also policy ``CMP0000``.

  Calling ``cmake_minimum_required()`` inside a ``function()``
  limits some effects to the function scope when invoked.  Such calls
  should not be made with the intention of having global effects.

Policy Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)`` command implicitly invokes the
``cmake_policy(VERSION)`` command to specify that the current
project code is written for the given range of CMake versions.
All policies known to the running version of CMake and introduced
in the ``<min>`` (or ``<max>``, if specified) version or earlier will
be set to use ``NEW`` behavior.  All policies introduced in later
versions will be unset.  This effectively requests behavior preferred
as of a given CMake version and tells newer CMake versions to warn
about their new policies.

When a ``<min>`` version higher than 2.4 is specified the command
implicitly invokes

 cmake_policy(VERSION <min>[...<max>])

which sets CMake policies based on the range of versions specified.
When a ``<min>`` version 2.4 or lower is given the command implicitly
invokes

 cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4[...<max>])

which enables compatibility features for CMake 2.4 and lower.

cmake_parse_arguments
---------------------

Parse function or macro arguments.

 cmake_parse_arguments(<prefix> <options> <one_value_keywords>
                       <multi_value_keywords> <args>...)

 cmake_parse_arguments(PARSE_ARGV <N> <prefix> <options>
                       <one_value_keywords> <multi_value_keywords>)

This command is for use in macros or functions.
It processes the arguments given to that macro or function,
and defines a set of variables which hold the values of the
respective options.

The first signature reads processes arguments passed in the ``<args>...``.
This may be used in either a ``macro()`` or a ``function()``.

The ``PARSE_ARGV`` signature is only for use in a ``function()``
body.  In this case the arguments that are parsed come from the
``ARGV#`` variables of the calling function.  The parsing starts with
the ``<N>``-th argument, where ``<N>`` is an unsigned integer.  This allows for
the values to have special characters like ``;`` in them.

The ``<options>`` argument contains all options for the respective macro,
i.e.  keywords which can be used when calling the macro without any value
following, like e.g.  the ``OPTIONAL`` keyword of the ``install()``
command.

The ``<one_value_keywords>`` argument contains all keywords for this macro
which are followed by one value, like e.g. ``DESTINATION`` keyword of the
``install()`` command.

The ``<multi_value_keywords>`` argument contains all keywords for this
macro which can be followed by more than one value, like e.g. the
``TARGETS`` or ``FILES`` keywords of the ``install()`` command.

.. note::

   All keywords shall be unique. I.e. every keyword shall only be specified
   once in either ``<options>``, ``<one_value_keywords>`` or
   ``<multi_value_keywords>``. A warning will be emitted if uniqueness is
   violated.

When done, ``cmake_parse_arguments`` will consider for each of the
keywords listed in ``<options>``, ``<one_value_keywords>`` and
``<multi_value_keywords>`` a variable composed of the given ``<prefix>``
followed by ``"_"`` and the name of the respective keyword.  These
variables will then hold the respective value from the argument list
or be undefined if the associated option could not be found.
For the ``<options>`` keywords, these will always be defined,
to ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE``, whether the option is in the argument list or not.

All remaining arguments are collected in a variable
``<prefix>_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS`` that will be undefined if all arguments
were recognized. This can be checked afterwards to see
whether your macro was called with unrecognized parameters.

``<one_value_keywords>`` and ``<multi_value_keywords>`` that were given no
values at all are collected in a variable ``<prefix>_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES``
that will be undefined if all keywords received values. This can be checked
to see if there were keywords without any values given.

Consider the following example macro, ``my_install()``, which takes similar
arguments to the real ``install()`` command:

 macro(my_install)
     set(options OPTIONAL FAST)
     set(oneValueArgs DESTINATION RENAME)
     set(multiValueArgs TARGETS CONFIGURATIONS)
     cmake_parse_arguments(MY_INSTALL "${options}" "${oneValueArgs}"
                           "${multiValueArgs}" ${ARGN} )

     # ...

Assume ``my_install()`` has been called like this:

 my_install(TARGETS foo bar DESTINATION bin OPTIONAL blub CONFIGURATIONS)

After the ``cmake_parse_arguments`` call the macro will have set or undefined
the following variables::

 MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL = TRUE
 MY_INSTALL_FAST = FALSE # was not used in call to my_install
 MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION = "bin"
 MY_INSTALL_RENAME <UNDEFINED> # was not used
 MY_INSTALL_TARGETS = "foo;bar"
 MY_INSTALL_CONFIGURATIONS <UNDEFINED> # was not used
 MY_INSTALL_UNPARSED_ARGUMENTS = "blub" # nothing expected after "OPTIONAL"
 MY_INSTALL_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES = "CONFIGURATIONS"
          # No value for "CONFIGURATIONS" given

You can then continue and process these variables.

Keywords terminate lists of values, e.g. if directly after a
``one_value_keyword`` another recognized keyword follows, this is
interpreted as the beginning of the new option.  E.g.
``my_install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION OPTIONAL)`` would result in
``MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION`` set to ``"OPTIONAL"``, but as ``OPTIONAL``
is a keyword itself ``MY_INSTALL_DESTINATION`` will be empty (but added
to ``MY_INSTALL_KEYWORDS_MISSING_VALUES``) and ``MY_INSTALL_OPTIONAL`` will
therefore be set to ``TRUE``.

cmake_policy
------------

Manage CMake Policy settings.  See the ``cmake-policies(7)``
manual for defined policies.

As CMake evolves it is sometimes necessary to change existing behavior
in order to fix bugs or improve implementations of existing features.
The CMake Policy mechanism is designed to help keep existing projects
building as new versions of CMake introduce changes in behavior.  Each
new policy (behavioral change) is given an identifier of the form
``CMP<NNNN>`` where ``<NNNN>`` is an integer index.  Documentation
associated with each policy describes the ``OLD`` and ``NEW`` behavior
and the reason the policy was introduced.  Projects may set each policy
to select the desired behavior.  When CMake needs to know which behavior
to use it checks for a setting specified by the project.  If no
setting is available the ``OLD`` behavior is assumed and a warning is
produced requesting that the policy be set.

Setting Policies by CMake Version
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``cmake_policy`` command is used to set policies to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
behavior.  While setting policies individually is supported, we
encourage projects to set policies based on CMake versions:

 cmake_policy(VERSION <min>[...<max>])

``<min>`` and the optional ``<max>`` are each CMake versions of the form
``major.minor[.patch[.tweak]]``, and the ``...`` is literal.  The ``<min>``
version must be at least ``2.4`` and at most the running version of CMake.
The ``<max>`` version, if specified, must be at least the ``<min>`` version
but may exceed the running version of CMake.  If the running version of
CMake is older than 3.12, the extra ``...`` dots will be seen as version
component separators, resulting in the ``...<max>`` part being ignored and
preserving the pre-3.12 behavior of basing policies on ``<min>``.

This specifies that the current CMake code is written for the given
range of CMake versions.  All policies known to the running version of CMake
and introduced in the ``<min>`` (or ``<max>``, if specified) version
or earlier will be set to use ``NEW`` behavior.  All policies
introduced in later versions will be unset (unless the
``CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>`` variable sets a default).
This effectively requests behavior preferred as of a given CMake
version and tells newer CMake versions to warn about their new policies.

Note that the ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)``
command implicitly calls ``cmake_policy(VERSION)`` too.

Setting Policies Explicitly
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> NEW)
 cmake_policy(SET CMP<NNNN> OLD)

Tell CMake to use the ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior for a given policy.
Projects depending on the old behavior of a given policy may silence a
policy warning by setting the policy state to ``OLD``.  Alternatively
one may fix the project to work with the new behavior and set the
policy state to ``NEW``.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Checking Policy Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 cmake_policy(GET CMP<NNNN> <variable>)

Check whether a given policy is set to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior.
The output ``<variable>`` value will be ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` if the
policy is set, and empty otherwise.

CMake Policy Stack
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake keeps policy settings on a stack, so changes made by the
``cmake_policy`` command affect only the top of the stack.  A new entry on
the policy stack is managed automatically for each subdirectory to
protect its parents and siblings.  CMake also manages a new entry for
scripts loaded by ``include()`` and ``find_package()`` commands
except when invoked with the ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option
(see also policy ``CMP0011``).
The ``cmake_policy`` command provides an interface to manage custom
entries on the policy stack:

 cmake_policy(PUSH)
 cmake_policy(POP)

Each ``PUSH`` must have a matching ``POP`` to erase any changes.
This is useful to make temporary changes to policy settings.
Calls to the ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)``,
``cmake_policy(VERSION)``, or ``cmake_policy(SET)`` commands
influence only the current top of the policy stack.

Commands created by the ``function()`` and ``macro()``
commands record policy settings when they are created and
use the pre-record policies when they are invoked.  If the function or
macro implementation sets policies, the changes automatically
propagate up through callers until they reach the closest nested
policy stack entry.

configure_file
--------------

Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

 configure_file(<input> <output>
                [COPYONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES] [@ONLY]
                [NEWLINE_STYLE [UNIX|DOS|WIN32|LF|CRLF] ])

Copies an ``<input>`` file to an ``<output>`` file and substitutes
variable values referenced as ``@VAR@`` or ``${VAR}`` in the input
file content.  Each variable reference will be replaced with the
current value of the variable, or the empty string if the variable
is not defined.  Furthermore, input lines of the form

 #cmakedefine VAR ...

will be replaced with either

 #define VAR ...

or

 /* #undef VAR */

depending on whether ``VAR`` is set in CMake to any value not considered
a false constant by the ``if()`` command.  The "..." content on the
line after the variable name, if any, is processed as above.
Input file lines of the form ``#cmakedefine01 VAR`` will be replaced with
either ``#define VAR 1`` or ``#define VAR 0`` similarly.
The result lines (with the exception of the ``#undef`` comments) can be
indented using spaces and/or tabs between the ``#`` character
and the ``cmakedefine`` or ``cmakedefine01`` words. This whitespace
indentation will be preserved in the output lines:

 #  cmakedefine VAR
 #  cmakedefine01 VAR

will be replaced, if ``VAR`` is defined, with

 #  define VAR
 #  define VAR 1

If the input file is modified the build system will re-run CMake to
re-configure the file and generate the build system again.
The generated file is modified and its timestamp updated on subsequent
cmake runs only if its content is changed.

The arguments are:

``<input>``
  Path to the input file.  A relative path is treated with respect to
  the value of ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``.  The input path
  must be a file, not a directory.

``<output>``
  Path to the output file or directory.  A relative path is treated
  with respect to the value of ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``.
  If the path names an existing directory the output file is placed
  in that directory with the same file name as the input file.

``COPYONLY``
  Copy the file without replacing any variable references or other
  content.  This option may not be used with ``NEWLINE_STYLE``.

``ESCAPE_QUOTES``
  Escape any substituted quotes with backslashes (C-style).

``@ONLY``
  Restrict variable replacement to references of the form ``@VAR@``.
  This is useful for configuring scripts that use ``${VAR}`` syntax.

``NEWLINE_STYLE <style>``
  Specify the newline style for the output file.  Specify
  ``UNIX`` or ``LF`` for ``\n`` newlines, or specify
  ``DOS``, ``WIN32``, or ``CRLF`` for ``\r\n`` newlines.
  This option may not be used with ``COPYONLY``.

Example
^^^^^^^

Consider a source tree containing a ``foo.h.in`` file:

 #cmakedefine FOO_ENABLE
 #cmakedefine FOO_STRING "@FOO_STRING@"

An adjacent ``CMakeLists.txt`` may use ``configure_file`` to
configure the header:

 option(FOO_ENABLE "Enable Foo" ON)
 if(FOO_ENABLE)
   set(FOO_STRING "foo")
 endif()
 configure_file(foo.h.in foo.h @ONLY)

This creates a ``foo.h`` in the build directory corresponding to
this source directory.  If the ``FOO_ENABLE`` option is on, the
configured file will contain:

 #define FOO_ENABLE
 #define FOO_STRING "foo"

Otherwise it will contain:

 /* #undef FOO_ENABLE */
 /* #undef FOO_STRING */

One may then use the ``include_directories()`` command to
specify the output directory as an include directory:

 include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})

so that sources may include the header as ``#include <foo.h>``.

continue
--------

Continue to the top of enclosing foreach or while loop.

 continue()

The ``continue`` command allows a cmake script to abort the rest of a block
in a ``foreach()`` or ``while()`` loop, and start at the top of
the next iteration.

the opening ``foreach`` clause.

endfunction
-----------

Ends a list of commands in a function block.

 endfunction([<name>])

See the ``function()`` command.

The optional ``<name>`` argument is supported for backward compatibility
only. If used it must be a verbatim repeat of the ``<name>`` argument
of the opening ``function`` command.

endif

of the opening ``macro`` command.

endwhile
--------

Ends a list of commands in a while block.

 endwhile([<condition>])

See the ``while()`` command.

The optional ``<condition>`` argument is supported for backward compatibility
only. If used it must be a verbatim repeat of the argument of the opening
``while`` clause.

execute_process
---------------

Execute one or more child processes.

 execute_process(COMMAND <cmd1> [<arguments>]
                 [COMMAND <cmd2> [<arguments>]]...
                 [WORKING_DIRECTORY <directory>]
                 [TIMEOUT <seconds>]
                 [RESULT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                 [RESULTS_VARIABLE <variable>]
                 [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <variable>]
                 [ERROR_VARIABLE <variable>]
                 [INPUT_FILE <file>]
                 [OUTPUT_FILE <file>]
                 [ERROR_FILE <file>]
                 [OUTPUT_QUIET]
                 [ERROR_QUIET]
                 [COMMAND_ECHO <where>]
                 [OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                 [ERROR_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE]
                 [ENCODING <name>])

Runs the given sequence of one or more commands.

Commands are executed concurrently as a pipeline, with the standard
output of each process piped to the standard input of the next.
A single standard error pipe is used for all processes.

Options:

``COMMAND``
 A child process command line.

 CMake executes the child process using operating system APIs directly.
 All arguments are passed VERBATIM to the child process.
 No intermediate shell is used, so shell operators such as ``>``
 are treated as normal arguments.
 (Use the ``INPUT_*``, ``OUTPUT_*``, and ``ERROR_*`` options to
 redirect stdin, stdout, and stderr.)

 If a sequential execution of multiple commands is required, use multiple
 ``execute_process()`` calls with a single ``COMMAND`` argument.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
 The named directory will be set as the current working directory of
 the child processes.

``TIMEOUT``
 After the specified number of seconds (fractions allowed), all unfinished
 child processes will be terminated, and the ``RESULT_VARIABLE`` will be
 set to a string mentioning the "timeout".

``RESULT_VARIABLE``
 The variable will be set to contain the result of last child process.
 This will be an integer return code from the last child or a string
 describing an error condition.

``RESULTS_VARIABLE <variable>``
 The variable will be set to contain the result of all processes as a
 :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>`, in order of the
 given ``COMMAND`` arguments.  Each entry will be an integer return code
 from the corresponding child or a string describing an error condition.

``OUTPUT_VARIABLE``, ``ERROR_VARIABLE``
 The variable named will be set with the contents of the standard output
 and standard error pipes, respectively.  If the same variable is named
 for both pipes their output will be merged in the order produced.

``INPUT_FILE, OUTPUT_FILE``, ``ERROR_FILE``
 The file named will be attached to the standard input of the first
 process, standard output of the last process, or standard error of
 all processes, respectively.  If the same file is named for both
 output and error then it will be used for both.

``OUTPUT_QUIET``, ``ERROR_QUIET``
 The standard output or standard error results will be quietly ignored.

``COMMAND_ECHO <where>``
 The command being run will be echo'ed to ``<where>`` with ``<where>``
 being set to one of ``STDERR``, ``STDOUT`` or ``NONE``.
 See the ``CMAKE_EXECUTE_PROCESS_COMMAND_ECHO`` variable for a way
 to control the default behavior when this option is not present.

``ENCODING <name>``
 On Windows, the encoding that is used to decode output from the process.
 Ignored on other platforms.
 Valid encoding names are:

 ``NONE``
   Perform no decoding.  This assumes that the process output is encoded
   in the same way as CMake's internal encoding (UTF-8).
   This is the default.
 ``AUTO``
   Use the current active console's codepage or if that isn't
   available then use ANSI.
 ``ANSI``
   Use the ANSI codepage.
 ``OEM``
   Use the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) code page.
 ``UTF8`` or ``UTF-8``
   Use the UTF-8 codepage. Prior to CMake 3.11.0, only ``UTF8`` was accepted
   for this encoding. In CMake 3.11.0, ``UTF-8`` was added for consistency with
   the UTF-8 RFC naming convention.

If more than one ``OUTPUT_*`` or ``ERROR_*`` option is given for the
same pipe the precedence is not specified.
If no ``OUTPUT_*`` or ``ERROR_*`` options are given the output will
be shared with the corresponding pipes of the CMake process itself.

The ``execute_process()`` command is a newer more powerful version of
``exec_program()``, but the old command has been kept for compatibility.
Both commands run while CMake is processing the project prior to build
system generation.  Use ``add_custom_target()`` and
``add_custom_command()`` to create custom commands that run at
build time.

Reading
^^^^^^^

 file(READ <filename> <variable>
      [OFFSET <offset>] [LIMIT <max-in>] [HEX])

Read content from a file called ``<filename>`` and store it in a
``<variable>``.  Optionally start from the given ``<offset>`` and
read at most ``<max-in>`` bytes.  The ``HEX`` option causes data to
be converted to a hexadecimal representation (useful for binary data).

 file(STRINGS <filename> <variable> [<options>...])

Parse a list of ASCII strings from ``<filename>`` and store it in
``<variable>``.  Binary data in the file are ignored.  Carriage return
(``\r``, CR) characters are ignored.  The options are:

``LENGTH_MAXIMUM <max-len>``
 Consider only strings of at most a given length.

``LENGTH_MINIMUM <min-len>``
 Consider only strings of at least a given length.

``LIMIT_COUNT <max-num>``
 Limit the number of distinct strings to be extracted.

``LIMIT_INPUT <max-in>``
 Limit the number of input bytes to read from the file.

``LIMIT_OUTPUT <max-out>``
 Limit the number of total bytes to store in the ``<variable>``.

``NEWLINE_CONSUME``
 Treat newline characters (``\n``, LF) as part of string content
 instead of terminating at them.

``NO_HEX_CONVERSION``
 Intel Hex and Motorola S-record files are automatically converted to
 binary while reading unless this option is given.

``REGEX <regex>``
 Consider only strings that match the given regular expression.

``ENCODING <encoding-type>``
 Consider strings of a given encoding.  Currently supported encodings are:
 UTF-8, UTF-16LE, UTF-16BE, UTF-32LE, UTF-32BE.  If the ENCODING option
 is not provided and the file has a Byte Order Mark, the ENCODING option
 will be defaulted to respect the Byte Order Mark.

For example, the code

 file(STRINGS myfile.txt myfile)

stores a list in the variable ``myfile`` in which each item is a line
from the input file.

 file(<HASH> <filename> <variable>)

Compute a cryptographic hash of the content of ``<filename>`` and
store it in a ``<variable>``.  The supported ``<HASH>`` algorithm names
are those listed by the :ref:`string(\<HASH\>) <Supported Hash Algorithms>`
command.

 file(TIMESTAMP <filename> <variable> [<format>] [UTC])

Compute a string representation of the modification time of ``<filename>``
and store it in ``<variable>``.  Should the command be unable to obtain a
timestamp variable will be set to the empty string ("").

See the ``string(TIMESTAMP)`` command for documentation of
the ``<format>`` and ``UTC`` options.

 file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
   [RESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_VAR <deps_var>]
   [UNRESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_VAR <unresolved_deps_var>]
   [CONFLICTING_DEPENDENCIES_PREFIX <conflicting_deps_prefix>]
   [EXECUTABLES [<executable_files>...]]
   [LIBRARIES [<library_files>...]]
   [MODULES [<module_files>...]]
   [DIRECTORIES [<directories>...]]
   [BUNDLE_EXECUTABLE <bundle_executable_file>]
   [PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES [<regexes>...]]
   [PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES [<regexes>...]]
   [POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES [<regexes>...]]
   [POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES [<regexes>...]]
   )

Recursively get the list of libraries depended on by the given files.

Please note that this sub-command is not intended to be used in project mode.
Instead, use it in an ``install(CODE)`` or ``install(SCRIPT)``
block. For example:

 install(CODE [[
   file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
     # ...
     )
   ]])

The arguments are as follows:

``RESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_VAR <deps_var>``
  Name of the variable in which to store the list of resolved dependencies.

``UNRESOLVED_DEPENDENCIES_VAR <unresolved_deps_var>``
  Name of the variable in which to store the list of unresolved dependencies.
  If this variable is not specified, and there are any unresolved dependencies,
  an error is issued.

``CONFLICTING_DEPENDENCIES_PREFIX <conflicting_deps_prefix>``
  Variable prefix in which to store conflicting dependency information.
  Dependencies are conflicting if two files with the same name are found in
  two different directories. The list of filenames that conflict are stored in
  ``<conflicting_deps_prefix>_FILENAMES``. For each filename, the list of paths
  that were found for that filename are stored in
  ``<conflicting_deps_prefix>_<filename>``.

``EXECUTABLES <executable_files>``
  List of executable files to read for dependencies. These are executables that
  are typically created with ``add_executable()``, but they do not have to
  be created by CMake. On Apple platforms, the paths to these files determine
  the value of ``@executable_path`` when recursively resolving the libraries.
  Specifying ``STATIC`` libraries, ``MODULE`` s, or ``SHARED`` libraries here
  will result in undefined behavior.

``LIBRARIES <library_files>``
  List of library files to read for dependencies. These are libraries that are
  typically created with ``add_library(SHARED)``, but they do not have
  to be created by CMake. Specifying ``STATIC`` libraries, ``MODULE`` s, or
  executables here will result in undefined behavior.

``MODULES <module_files>``
  List of loadable module files to read for dependencies. These are modules
  that are typically created with ``add_library(MODULE)``, but they do
  not have to be created by CMake. They are typically used by calling
  ``dlopen()`` at runtime rather than linked at link time with ``ld -l``.
  Specifying ``STATIC`` libraries, ``SHARED`` libraries, or executables here
  will result in undefined behavior.

``DIRECTORIES <directories>``
  List of additional directories to search for dependencies. On Linux
  platforms, these directories are searched if the dependency is not found in
  any of the other usual paths. If it is found in such a directory, a warning
  is issued, because it means that the file is incomplete (it does not list all
  of the directories that contain its dependencies.) On Windows platforms,
  these directories are searched if the dependency is not found in any of the
  other search paths, but no warning is issued, because searching other paths
  is a normal part of Windows dependency resolution. On Apple platforms, this
  argument has no effect.

``BUNDLE_EXECTUBLE <bundle_executable_file>``
  Executable to treat as the "bundle executable" when resolving libraries. On
  Apple platforms, this argument determines the value of ``@executable_path``
  when recursively resolving libraries for ``LIBRARIES`` and ``MODULES`` files.
  It has no effect on ``EXECUTABLES`` files. On other platforms, it has no
  effect. This is typically (but not always) one of the executables in the
  ``EXECUTABLES`` argument which designates the "main" executable of the
  package.

The following arguments specify filters for including or excluding libraries to
be resolved. See below for a full description of how they work.

``PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES <regexes>``
  List of pre-include regexes through which to filter the names of
  not-yet-resolved dependencies.

``PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES <regexes>``
  List of pre-exclude regexes through which to filter the names of
  not-yet-resolved dependencies.

``POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES <regexes>``
  List of post-include regexes through which to filter the names of resolved
  dependencies.

``POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES <regexes>``
  List of post-exclude regexes through which to filter the names of resolved
  dependencies.

These arguments can be used to blacklist unwanted system libraries when
resolving the dependencies, or to whitelist libraries from a specific
directory. The filtering works as follows:

1. If the not-yet-resolved dependency matches any of the
   ``PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES``, steps 2 and 3 are skipped, and the dependency
   resolution proceeds to step 4.
2. If the not-yet-resolved dependency matches any of the
   ``PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES``, dependency resolution stops for that dependency.
3. Otherwise, dependency resolution proceeds.
4. ``file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)`` searches for the dependency according to
   the linking rules of the platform (see below).
5. If the dependency is found, and its full path matches one of the
   ``POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES``, the full path is added to the resolved
   dependencies, and ``file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)`` recursively resolves
   that library's own dependencies. Otherwise, resolution proceeds to step 6.
6. If the dependency is found, but its full path matches one of the
   ``POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES``, it is not added to the resolved dependencies, and
   dependency resolution stops for that dependency.
7. If the dependency is found, and its full path does not match either
   ``POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES`` or ``POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES``, the full path is added
   to the resolved dependencies, and ``file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES)``
   recursively resolves that library's own dependencies.

Different platforms have different rules for how dependencies are resolved.
These specifics are described here.

On Linux platforms, library resolution works as follows:

1. If the depending file does not have any ``RUNPATH`` entries, and the library
   exists in one of the depending file's ``RPATH`` entries, or its parents', in
   that order, the dependency is resolved to that file.
2. Otherwise, if the depending file has any ``RUNPATH`` entries, and the
   library exists in one of those entries, the dependency is resolved to that
   file.
3. Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the directories listed by
   ``ldconfig``, the dependency is resolved to that file.
4. Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the ``DIRECTORIES`` entries, the
   dependency is resolved to that file. In this case, a warning is issued,
   because finding a file in one of the ``DIRECTORIES`` means that the
   depending file is not complete (it does not list all the directories from
   which it pulls dependencies.)
5. Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

On Windows platforms, library resolution works as follows:

1. The dependent DLL name is converted to lowercase. Windows DLL names are
   case-insensitive, and some linkers mangle the case of the DLL dependency
   names. However, this makes it more difficult for ``PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES``,
   ``PRE_EXCLUDE_REGEXES``, ``POST_INCLUDE_REGEXES``, and
   ``POST_EXCLUDE_REGEXES`` to properly filter DLL names - every regex would
   have to check for both uppercase and lowercase letters. For example:

   .. code-block:: cmake

     file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
       # ...
       PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES "^[Mm][Yy][Ll][Ii][Bb][Rr][Aa][Rr][Yy]\\.[Dd][Ll][Ll]$"
       )

   Converting the DLL name to lowercase allows the regexes to only match
   lowercase names, thus simplifying the regex. For example:

   .. code-block:: cmake

     file(GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES
       # ...
       PRE_INCLUDE_REGEXES "^mylibrary\\.dll$"
       )

   This regex will match ``mylibrary.dll`` regardless of how it is cased,
   either on disk or in the depending file. (For example, it will match
   ``mylibrary.dll``, ``MyLibrary.dll``, and ``MYLIBRARY.DLL``.)

   Please note that the directory portion of any resolved DLLs retains its
   casing and is not converted to lowercase. Only the filename portion is
   converted.

2. (**Not yet implemented**) If the depending file is a Windows Store app, and
   the dependency is listed as a dependency in the application's package
   manifest, the dependency is resolved to that file.
3. Otherwise, if the library exists in the same directory as the depending
   file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
4. Otherwise, if the library exists in either the operating system's
   ``system32`` directory or the ``Windows`` directory, in that order, the
   dependency is resolved to that file.
5. Otherwise, if the library exists in one of the directories specified by
   ``DIRECTORIES``, in the order they are listed, the dependency is resolved to
   that file. (In this case, a warning is not issued, because searching other
   directories is a normal part of Windows library resolution.)
6. Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

On Apple platforms, library resolution works as follows:

1. If the dependency starts with ``@executable_path/``, and an ``EXECUTABLES``
   argument is in the process of being resolved, and replacing
   ``@executable_path/`` with the directory of the executable yields an
   existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
2. Otherwise, if the dependency starts with ``@executable_path/``, and there is
   a ``BUNDLE_EXECUTABLE`` argument, and replacing ``@executable_path/`` with
   the directory of the bundle executable yields an existing file, the
   dependency is resolved to that file.
3. Otherwise, if the dependency starts with ``@loader_path/``, and replacing
   ``@loader_path/`` with the directory of the depending file yields an
   existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file.
4. Otherwise, if the dependency starts with ``@rpath/``, and replacing
   ``@rpath/`` with one of the ``RPATH`` entries of the depending file yields
   an existing file, the dependency is resolved to that file. (Note that
   ``RPATH`` entries that start with ``@executable_path/`` or ``@loader_path/``
   also have these items replaced with the appropriate path.)
5. Otherwise, if the dependency is an absolute file that exists, the dependency
   is resolved to that file.
6. Otherwise, the dependency is unresolved.

This function accepts several variables that determine which tool is used for
dependency resolution:

.. variable:: CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_PLATFORM

  Determines which operating system and executable format the files are built
  for. This could be one of several values:

  * ``linux+elf``
  * ``windows+pe``
  * ``macos+macho``

  If this variable is not specified, it is determined automatically by system
  introspection.

.. variable:: CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_TOOL

  Determines the tool to use for dependency resolution. It could be one of
  several values, depending on the value of
  ``CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_PLATFORM``:

  ================================================= =============================================
     ``CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_PLATFORM``       ``CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_TOOL``
  ================================================= =============================================
  ``linux+elf``                                     ``objdump``
  ``windows+pe``                                    ``dumpbin``
  ``windows+pe``                                    ``objdump``
  ``macos+macho``                                   ``otool``
  ================================================= =============================================

  If this variable is not specified, it is determined automatically by system
  introspection.

.. variable:: CMAKE_GET_RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_COMMAND

  Determines the path to the tool to use for dependency resolution. This is the
  actual path to ``objdump``, ``dumpbin``, or ``otool``.

  If this variable is not specified, it is determined automatically by system
  introspection.

Writing
^^^^^^^

 file(WRITE <filename> <content>...)
 file(APPEND <filename> <content>...)

Write ``<content>`` into a file called ``<filename>``.  If the file does
not exist, it will be created.  If the file already exists, ``WRITE``
mode will overwrite it and ``APPEND`` mode will append to the end.
Any directories in the path specified by ``<filename>`` that do not
exist will be created.

If the file is a build input, use the ``configure_file()`` command
to update the file only when its content changes.

 file(TOUCH [<files>...])
 file(TOUCH_NOCREATE [<files>...])

Create a file with no content if it does not yet exist. If the file already
exists, its access and/or modification will be updated to the time when the
function call is executed.

Use TOUCH_NOCREATE to touch a file if it exists but not create it. If a file
does not exist it will be silently ignored.

With TOUCH and TOUCH_NOCREATE the contents of an existing file will not be
modified.

 file(GENERATE OUTPUT output-file
      <INPUT input-file|CONTENT content>
      [CONDITION expression])

Generate an output file for each build configuration supported by the current
``CMake Generator``.  Evaluate
``generator expressions``
from the input content to produce the output content.  The options are:

``CONDITION <condition>``
  Generate the output file for a particular configuration only if
  the condition is true.  The condition must be either ``0`` or ``1``
  after evaluating generator expressions.

``CONTENT <content>``
  Use the content given explicitly as input.

``INPUT <input-file>``
  Use the content from a given file as input.
  A relative path is treated with respect to the value of
  ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``.  See policy ``CMP0070``.

``OUTPUT <output-file>``
  Specify the output file name to generate.  Use generator expressions
  such as ``$<CONFIG>`` to specify a configuration-specific output file
  name.  Multiple configurations may generate the same output file only
  if the generated content is identical.  Otherwise, the ``<output-file>``
  must evaluate to an unique name for each configuration.
  A relative path (after evaluating generator expressions) is treated
  with respect to the value of ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``.
  See policy ``CMP0070``.

Exactly one ``CONTENT`` or ``INPUT`` option must be given.  A specific
``OUTPUT`` file may be named by at most one invocation of ``file(GENERATE)``.
Generated files are modified and their timestamp updated on subsequent cmake
runs only if their content is changed.

Note also that ``file(GENERATE)`` does not create the output file until the
generation phase. The output file will not yet have been written when the
``file(GENERATE)`` command returns, it is written only after processing all
of a project's ``CMakeLists.txt`` files.

Filesystem
^^^^^^^^^^

 file(GLOB <variable>
      [LIST_DIRECTORIES true|false] [RELATIVE <path>] [CONFIGURE_DEPENDS]
      [<globbing-expressions>...])
 file(GLOB_RECURSE <variable> [FOLLOW_SYMLINKS]
      [LIST_DIRECTORIES true|false] [RELATIVE <path>] [CONFIGURE_DEPENDS]
      [<globbing-expressions>...])

Generate a list of files that match the ``<globbing-expressions>`` and
store it into the ``<variable>``.  Globbing expressions are similar to
regular expressions, but much simpler.  If ``RELATIVE`` flag is
specified, the results will be returned as relative paths to the given
path.  The results will be ordered lexicographically.

On Windows and macOS, globbing is case-insensitive even if the underlying
filesystem is case-sensitive (both filenames and globbing expressions are
converted to lowercase before matching).  On other platforms, globbing is
case-sensitive.

If the ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` flag is specified, CMake will add logic
to the main build system check target to rerun the flagged ``GLOB`` commands
at build time. If any of the outputs change, CMake will regenerate the build
system.

By default ``GLOB`` lists directories - directories are omitted in result if
``LIST_DIRECTORIES`` is set to false.

.. note::
  We do not recommend using GLOB to collect a list of source files from
  your source tree.  If no CMakeLists.txt file changes when a source is
  added or removed then the generated build system cannot know when to
  ask CMake to regenerate.
  The ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` flag may not work reliably on all generators, or if
  a new generator is added in the future that cannot support it, projects using
  it will be stuck. Even if ``CONFIGURE_DEPENDS`` works reliably, there is
  still a cost to perform the check on every rebuild.

Examples of globbing expressions include::

 *.cxx      - match all files with extension cxx
 *.vt?      - match all files with extension vta,...,vtz
 f[3-5].txt - match files f3.txt, f4.txt, f5.txt

The ``GLOB_RECURSE`` mode will traverse all the subdirectories of the
matched directory and match the files.  Subdirectories that are symlinks
are only traversed if ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given or policy
``CMP0009`` is not set to ``NEW``.

By default ``GLOB_RECURSE`` omits directories from result list - setting
``LIST_DIRECTORIES`` to true adds directories to result list.
If ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given or policy ``CMP0009`` is not set to
``OLD`` then ``LIST_DIRECTORIES`` treats symlinks as directories.

Examples of recursive globbing include::

 /dir/*.py  - match all python files in /dir and subdirectories

 file(RENAME <oldname> <newname>)

Move a file or directory within a filesystem from ``<oldname>`` to
``<newname>``, replacing the destination atomically.

 file(REMOVE [<files>...])
 file(REMOVE_RECURSE [<files>...])

Remove the given files.  The ``REMOVE_RECURSE`` mode will remove the given
files and directories, also non-empty directories. No error is emitted if a
given file does not exist.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect
to the current source directory.  Empty input paths are ignored with a warning.

 file(MAKE_DIRECTORY [<directories>...])

Create the given directories and their parents as needed.

 file(<COPY|INSTALL> <files>... DESTINATION <dir>
      [FILE_PERMISSIONS <permissions>...]
      [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS <permissions>...]
      [NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS]
      [FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN]
      [FILES_MATCHING]
      [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
       [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS <permissions>...]] [...])

The ``COPY`` signature copies files, directories, and symlinks to a
destination folder.  Relative input paths are evaluated with respect
to the current source directory, and a relative destination is
evaluated with respect to the current build directory.  Copying
preserves input file timestamps, and optimizes out a file if it exists
at the destination with the same timestamp.  Copying preserves input
permissions unless explicit permissions or ``NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS``
are given (default is ``USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS``).

If ``FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN`` is specified, ``COPY`` will recursively resolve
the symlinks at the paths given until a real file is found, and install
a corresponding symlink in the destination for each symlink encountered. For
each symlink that is installed, the resolution is stripped of the directory,
leaving only the filename, meaning that the new symlink points to a file in
the same directory as the symlink. This feature is useful on some Unix systems,
where libraries are installed as a chain of symlinks with version numbers, with
less specific versions pointing to more specific versions.
``FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN`` will install all of these symlinks and the library
itself into the destination directory. For example, if you have the following
directory structure:

* ``/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1.2.3``
* ``/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1.2 -> libfoo.so.1.2.3``
* ``/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so.1 -> libfoo.so.1.2``
* ``/opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so -> libfoo.so.1``

and you do:

 file(COPY /opt/foo/lib/libfoo.so DESTINATION lib FOLLOW_SYMLINK_CHAIN)

This will install all of the symlinks and ``libfoo.so.1.2.3`` itself into
``lib``.

See the ``install(DIRECTORY)`` command for documentation of
permissions, ``FILES_MATCHING``, ``PATTERN``, ``REGEX``, and
``EXCLUDE`` options.  Copying directories preserves the structure
of their content even if options are used to select a subset of
files.

The ``INSTALL`` signature differs slightly from ``COPY``: it prints
status messages (subject to the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE`` variable),
and ``NO_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`` is default.
Installation scripts generated by the ``install()`` command
use this signature (with some undocumented options for internal use).

 file(SIZE <filename> <variable>)

Determine the file size of the ``<filename>`` and put the result in
``<variable>`` variable. Requires that ``<filename>`` is a valid path
pointing to a file and is readable.

 file(READ_SYMLINK <linkname> <variable>)

This subcommand queries the symlink ``<linkname>`` and stores the path it
points to in the result ``<variable>``.  If ``<linkname>`` does not exist or
is not a symlink, CMake issues a fatal error.

Note that this command returns the raw symlink path and does not resolve
a relative path.  The following is an example of how to ensure that an
absolute path is obtained:

 set(linkname "/path/to/foo.sym")
 file(READ_SYMLINK "${linkname}" result)
 if(NOT IS_ABSOLUTE "${result}")
   get_filename_component(dir "${linkname}" DIRECTORY)
   set(result "${dir}/${result}")
 endif()

 file(CREATE_LINK <original> <linkname>
      [RESULT <result>] [COPY_ON_ERROR] [SYMBOLIC])

Create a link ``<linkname>`` that points to ``<original>``.
It will be a hard link by default, but providing the ``SYMBOLIC`` option
results in a symbolic link instead.  Hard links require that ``original``
exists and is a file, not a directory.  If ``<linkname>`` already exists,
it will be overwritten.

The ``<result>`` variable, if specified, receives the status of the operation.
It is set to ``0`` upon success or an error message otherwise.  If ``RESULT``
is not specified and the operation fails, a fatal error is emitted.

Specifying ``COPY_ON_ERROR`` enables copying the file as a fallback if
creating the link fails.  It can be useful for handling situations such as
``<original>`` and ``<linkname>`` being on different drives or mount points,
which would make them unable to support a hard link.

Path Conversion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 file(RELATIVE_PATH <variable> <directory> <file>)

Compute the relative path from a ``<directory>`` to a ``<file>`` and
store it in the ``<variable>``.

 file(TO_CMAKE_PATH "<path>" <variable>)
 file(TO_NATIVE_PATH "<path>" <variable>)

The ``TO_CMAKE_PATH`` mode converts a native ``<path>`` into a cmake-style
path with forward-slashes (``/``).  The input can be a single path or a
system search path like ``$ENV{PATH}``.  A search path will be converted
to a cmake-style list separated by ``;`` characters.

The ``TO_NATIVE_PATH`` mode converts a cmake-style ``<path>`` into a native
path with platform-specific slashes (``\`` on Windows and ``/`` elsewhere).

Always use double quotes around the ``<path>`` to be sure it is treated
as a single argument to this command.

Transfer
^^^^^^^^

 file(DOWNLOAD <url> <file> [<options>...])
 file(UPLOAD   <file> <url> [<options>...])

The ``DOWNLOAD`` mode downloads the given ``<url>`` to a local ``<file>``.
The ``UPLOAD`` mode uploads a local ``<file>`` to a given ``<url>``.

Options to both ``DOWNLOAD`` and ``UPLOAD`` are:

``INACTIVITY_TIMEOUT <seconds>``
  Terminate the operation after a period of inactivity.

``LOG <variable>``
  Store a human-readable log of the operation in a variable.

``SHOW_PROGRESS``
  Print progress information as status messages until the operation is
  complete.

``STATUS <variable>``
  Store the resulting status of the operation in a variable.
  The status is a ``;`` separated list of length 2.
  The first element is the numeric return value for the operation,
  and the second element is a string value for the error.
  A ``0`` numeric error means no error in the operation.

``TIMEOUT <seconds>``
  Terminate the operation after a given total time has elapsed.

``USERPWD <username>:<password>``
  Set username and password for operation.

``HTTPHEADER <HTTP-header>``
  HTTP header for operation. Suboption can be repeated several times.

``NETRC <level>``
  Specify whether the .netrc file is to be used for operation.  If this
  option is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC`` variable
  will be used instead.
  Valid levels are:

  ``IGNORED``
    The .netrc file is ignored.
    This is the default.
  ``OPTIONAL``
    The .netrc file is optional, and information in the URL is preferred.
    The file will be scanned to find which ever information is not specified
    in the URL.
  ``REQUIRED``
    The .netrc file is required, and information in the URL is ignored.

``NETRC_FILE <file>``
  Specify an alternative .netrc file to the one in your home directory,
  if the ``NETRC`` level is ``OPTIONAL`` or ``REQUIRED``. If this option
  is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC_FILE`` variable will
  be used instead.

If neither ``NETRC`` option is given CMake will check variables
``CMAKE_NETRC`` and ``CMAKE_NETRC_FILE``, respectively.

Additional options to ``DOWNLOAD`` are:

``EXPECTED_HASH ALGO=<value>``

  Verify that the downloaded content hash matches the expected value, where
  ``ALGO`` is one of the algorithms supported by ``file(<HASH>)``.
  If it does not match, the operation fails with an error.

``EXPECTED_MD5 <value>``
  Historical short-hand for ``EXPECTED_HASH MD5=<value>``.

``TLS_VERIFY <ON|OFF>``
  Specify whether to verify the server certificate for ``https://`` URLs.
  The default is to *not* verify.

``TLS_CAINFO <file>``
  Specify a custom Certificate Authority file for ``https://`` URLs.

For ``https://`` URLs CMake must be built with OpenSSL support.  ``TLS/SSL``
certificates are not checked by default.  Set ``TLS_VERIFY`` to ``ON`` to
check certificates and/or use ``EXPECTED_HASH`` to verify downloaded content.
If neither ``TLS`` option is given CMake will check variables
``CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY`` and ``CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO``, respectively.

Locking
^^^^^^^

 file(LOCK <path> [DIRECTORY] [RELEASE]
      [GUARD <FUNCTION|FILE|PROCESS>]
      [RESULT_VARIABLE <variable>]
      [TIMEOUT <seconds>])

Lock a file specified by ``<path>`` if no ``DIRECTORY`` option present and file
``<path>/cmake.lock`` otherwise. File will be locked for scope defined by
``GUARD`` option (default value is ``PROCESS``). ``RELEASE`` option can be used
to unlock file explicitly. If option ``TIMEOUT`` is not specified CMake will
wait until lock succeed or until fatal error occurs. If ``TIMEOUT`` is set to
``0`` lock will be tried once and result will be reported immediately. If
``TIMEOUT`` is not ``0`` CMake will try to lock file for the period specified
by ``<seconds>`` value. Any errors will be interpreted as fatal if there is no
``RESULT_VARIABLE`` option. Otherwise result will be stored in ``<variable>``
and will be ``0`` on success or error message on failure.

Note that lock is advisory - there is no guarantee that other processes will
respect this lock, i.e. lock synchronize two or more CMake instances sharing
some modifiable resources. Similar logic applied to ``DIRECTORY`` option -
locking parent directory doesn't prevent other ``LOCK`` commands to lock any
child directory or file.

Trying to lock file twice is not allowed.  Any intermediate directories and
file itself will be created if they not exist.  ``GUARD`` and ``TIMEOUT``
options ignored on ``RELEASE`` operation.

find_file
---------

A short-hand signature is:

 find_file (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

The general signature is:

 find_file (
           <VAR>
           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
           [DOC "cache documentation string"]
           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
           [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
          )

This command is used to find a full path to named file.
A cache entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result
of this command.
If the full path to a file is found the result is stored in the variable
and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.
If nothing is found, the result will be
``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, and the search will be attempted again the
next time find_file is invoked with the same variable.

Options include:

``NAMES``
  Specify one or more possible names for the full path to a file.

  When using this to specify names with and without a version
  suffix, we recommend specifying the unversioned name first
  so that locally-built packages can be found before those
  provided by distributions.

``HINTS``, ``PATHS``
  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.
  The ``ENV var`` sub-option reads paths from a system environment
  variable.

``PATH_SUFFIXES``
  Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory
  location otherwise considered.

``DOC``
  Specify the documentation string for the ``<VAR>`` cache entry.

If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified, then no additional paths are
added to the search.
If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is not specified, the search process is as follows:

1. If called from within a find module or any other script loaded by a call to
   ``find_package(<PackageName>)``, search prefixes unique to the
   current package being found.  Specifically, look in the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable.
   The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from
   nested find modules or config packages, root paths from the parent's find
   module or config package will be searched after paths from the current
   module or package.  In other words, the search order would be
   ``<CurrentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<CurrentPackage>_ROOT}``,
   ``<ParentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<ParentPackage>_ROOT}``, etc.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.
   See policy ``CMP0074``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable if called from within a find module loaded by ``find_package(<PackageName>)``

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.
   These are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`semicolon-separated lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or
   by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

4. Search the paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.
   These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
   hint provided by the location of another item already found.
   Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or by
   setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * The directories in ``PATH`` and ``INCLUDE``.
   * On Windows hosts: ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` in ``PATH``, and ``<entry>/include`` for other entries in ``PATH``.

6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
   for the current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   is passed or by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option
   or in the short-hand version of the command.
   These are typically hard-coded guesses.

On macOS the ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variables determine the order of
preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

The CMake variable ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` are excluded
from this re-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` is empty.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` are searched, then the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT``
directory is searched, and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE``.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis using options:

``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH``
  Search in the order described above.

``NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Do not use the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` variable.

``ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below
  ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.

The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
least-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the ``NO_*`` options:

 find_file (<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
 find_file (<VAR> NAMES name)

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

find_library
------------

A short-hand signature is:

 find_library (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

The general signature is:

 find_library (
           <VAR>
           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]
           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
           [DOC "cache documentation string"]
           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
           [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
          )

This command is used to find a library.
A cache entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result
of this command.
If the library is found the result is stored in the variable
and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.
If nothing is found, the result will be
``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, and the search will be attempted again the
next time find_library is invoked with the same variable.

Options include:

``NAMES``
  Specify one or more possible names for the library.

  When using this to specify names with and without a version
  suffix, we recommend specifying the unversioned name first
  so that locally-built packages can be found before those
  provided by distributions.

``HINTS``, ``PATHS``
  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.
  The ``ENV var`` sub-option reads paths from a system environment
  variable.

``PATH_SUFFIXES``
  Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory
  location otherwise considered.

``DOC``
  Specify the documentation string for the ``<VAR>`` cache entry.

If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified, then no additional paths are
added to the search.
If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is not specified, the search process is as follows:

1. If called from within a find module or any other script loaded by a call to
   ``find_package(<PackageName>)``, search prefixes unique to the
   current package being found.  Specifically, look in the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable.
   The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from
   nested find modules or config packages, root paths from the parent's find
   module or config package will be searched after paths from the current
   module or package.  In other words, the search order would be
   ``<CurrentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<CurrentPackage>_ROOT}``,
   ``<ParentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<ParentPackage>_ROOT}``, etc.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.
   See policy ``CMP0074``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable if called from within a find module loaded by ``find_package(<PackageName>)``

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.
   These are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`semicolon-separated lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or
   by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

4. Search the paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.
   These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
   hint provided by the location of another item already found.
   Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or by
   setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * The directories in ``PATH`` and ``INCLUDE``.
   * On Windows hosts: ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` in ``PATH``, and ``<entry>/lib`` for other entries in ``PATH``.

6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
   for the current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   is passed or by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/lib`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option
   or in the short-hand version of the command.
   These are typically hard-coded guesses.

On macOS the ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variables determine the order of
preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

The CMake variable ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` are excluded
from this re-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` is empty.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` are searched, then the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT``
directory is searched, and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY``.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis using options:

``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH``
  Search in the order described above.

``NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Do not use the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` variable.

``ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below
  ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.

The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
least-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the ``NO_*`` options:

 find_library (<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
 find_library (<VAR> NAMES name)

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

When more than one value is given to the ``NAMES`` option this command by
default will consider one name at a time and search every directory
for it.  The ``NAMES_PER_DIR`` option tells this command to consider one
directory at a time and search for all names in it.

Each library name given to the ``NAMES`` option is first considered
as a library file name and then considered with platform-specific
prefixes (e.g. ``lib``) and suffixes (e.g. ``.so``).  Therefore one
may specify library file names such as ``libfoo.a`` directly.
This can be used to locate static libraries on UNIX-like systems.

If the library found is a framework, then ``<VAR>`` will be set to the full
path to the framework ``<fullPath>/A.framework``.  When a full path to a
framework is used as a library, CMake will use a ``-framework A``, and a
``-F<fullPath>`` to link the framework to the target.

If the ``CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX`` variable is set all
search paths will be tested as normal, with the suffix appended, and with
all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with
``lib${CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX}/``.  This variable overrides
the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS``,
``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS``,
and ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS`` global properties.

If the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``32/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``lib32/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the ``project()`` command
is enabled.

If the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``x32/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``libx32/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the ``project()`` command
is enabled.

If the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS`` global property is set
all search paths will be tested as normal, with ``64/`` appended, and
with all matches of ``lib/`` replaced with ``lib64/``.  This property is
automatically set for the platforms that are known to need it if at
least one of the languages supported by the ``project()`` command
is enabled.

find_package
------------

Find an external project, and load its settings.

Basic Signature and Module Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 find_package(<PackageName> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET] [MODULE]
              [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
              [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
              [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

Finds and loads settings from an external project.  ``<PackageName>_FOUND``
will be set to indicate whether the package was found.  When the
package is found package-specific information is provided through
variables and :ref:`Imported Targets` documented by the package itself.  The
``QUIET`` option disables informational messages, including those indicating
that the package cannot be found if it is not ``REQUIRED``.  The ``REQUIRED``
option stops processing with an error message if the package cannot be found.

A package-specific list of required components may be listed after the
``COMPONENTS`` option (or after the ``REQUIRED`` option if present).
Additional optional components may be listed after
``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS``.  Available components and their influence on
whether a package is considered to be found are defined by the target
package.

The ``[version]`` argument requests a version with which the package found
should be compatible (format is ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).  The
``EXACT`` option requests that the version be matched exactly.  If no
``[version]`` and/or component list is given to a recursive invocation
inside a find-module, the corresponding arguments are forwarded
automatically from the outer call (including the ``EXACT`` flag for
``[version]``).  Version support is currently provided only on a
package-by-package basis (see the Version Selection section below).

See the ``cmake_policy()`` command documentation for discussion
of the ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option.

The command has two modes by which it searches for packages: "Module"
mode and "Config" mode.  The above signature selects Module mode.
If no module is found the command falls back to Config mode, described
below. This fall back is disabled if the ``MODULE`` option is given.

In Module mode, CMake searches for a file called ``Find<PackageName>.cmake``.
The file is first searched in the ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``,
then among the :ref:`Find Modules` provided by the CMake installation.
If the file is found, it is read and processed by CMake.  It is responsible
for finding the package, checking the version, and producing any needed
messages.  Some find-modules provide limited or no support for versioning;
check the module documentation.

If the ``MODULE`` option is not specfied in the above signature,
CMake first searches for the package using Module mode. Then, if the
package is not found, it searches again using Config mode. A user
may set the variable ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG`` to
``TRUE`` to direct CMake first search using Config mode before falling
back to Module mode.

Full Signature and Config Mode
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

User code should generally look for packages using the above `basic
signature`_.  The remainder of this command documentation specifies the
full command signature and details of the search process.  Project
maintainers wishing to provide a package to be found by this command
are encouraged to read on.

The complete Config mode command signature is

 find_package(<PackageName> [version] [EXACT] [QUIET]
              [REQUIRED] [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
              [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
              [CONFIG|NO_MODULE]
              [NO_POLICY_SCOPE]
              [NAMES name1 [name2 ...]]
              [CONFIGS config1 [config2 ...]]
              [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ]]
              [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ]]
              [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
              [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
              [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
              [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
              [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
              [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
              [NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
              [NO_CMAKE_BUILDS_PATH] # Deprecated; does nothing.
              [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
              [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY]
              [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
               ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
               NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH])

The ``CONFIG`` option, the synonymous ``NO_MODULE`` option, or the use
of options not specified in the basic signature all enforce pure Config
mode.  In pure Config mode, the command skips Module mode search and
proceeds at once with Config mode search.

Config mode search attempts to locate a configuration file provided by the
package to be found.  A cache entry called ``<PackageName>_DIR`` is created to
hold the directory containing the file.  By default the command
searches for a package with the name ``<PackageName>``.  If the ``NAMES`` option
is given the names following it are used instead of ``<PackageName>``.
The command searches for a file called ``<PackageName>Config.cmake`` or
``<lower-case-package-name>-config.cmake`` for each name specified.
A replacement set of possible configuration file names may be given
using the ``CONFIGS`` option.  The search procedure is specified below.
Once found, the configuration file is read and processed by CMake.
Since the file is provided by the package it already knows the
location of package contents.  The full path to the configuration file
is stored in the cmake variable ``<PackageName>_CONFIG``.

All configuration files which have been considered by CMake while
searching for an installation of the package with an appropriate
version are stored in the cmake variable ``<PackageName>_CONSIDERED_CONFIGS``,
the associated versions in ``<PackageName>_CONSIDERED_VERSIONS``.

If the package configuration file cannot be found CMake will generate
an error describing the problem unless the ``QUIET`` argument is
specified.  If ``REQUIRED`` is specified and the package is not found a
fatal error is generated and the configure step stops executing.  If
``<PackageName>_DIR`` has been set to a directory not containing a
configuration file CMake will ignore it and search from scratch.

Package maintainers providing CMake package configuration files are
encouraged to name and install them such that the Search Procedure
outlined below will find them without requiring use of additional options.

Version Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the ``[version]`` argument is given Config mode will only find a
version of the package that claims compatibility with the requested
version (format is ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``).  If the ``EXACT``
option is given only a version of the package claiming an exact match
of the requested version may be found.  CMake does not establish any
convention for the meaning of version numbers.  Package version
numbers are checked by "version" files provided by the packages
themselves.  For a candidate package configuration file
``<config-file>.cmake`` the corresponding version file is located next
to it and named either ``<config-file>-version.cmake`` or
``<config-file>Version.cmake``.  If no such version file is available
then the configuration file is assumed to not be compatible with any
requested version.  A basic version file containing generic version
matching code can be created using the
``CMakePackageConfigHelpers`` module.  When a version file
is found it is loaded to check the requested version number.  The
version file is loaded in a nested scope in which the following
variables have been defined:

``PACKAGE_FIND_NAME``
  the ``<PackageName>``
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION``
  full requested version string
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``
  major version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``
  minor version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``
  patch version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``
  tweak version if requested, else 0
``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``
  number of version components, 0 to 4

The version file checks whether it satisfies the requested version and
sets these variables:

``PACKAGE_VERSION``
  full provided version string
``PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT``
  true if version is exact match
``PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE``
  true if version is compatible
``PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE``
  true if unsuitable as any version

These variables are checked by the ``find_package`` command to determine
whether the configuration file provides an acceptable version.  They
are not available after the ``find_package`` call returns.  If the version
is acceptable the following variables are set:

``<PackageName>_VERSION``
  full provided version string
``<PackageName>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  major version if provided, else 0
``<PackageName>_VERSION_MINOR``
  minor version if provided, else 0
``<PackageName>_VERSION_PATCH``
  patch version if provided, else 0
``<PackageName>_VERSION_TWEAK``
  tweak version if provided, else 0
``<PackageName>_VERSION_COUNT``
  number of version components, 0 to 4

and the corresponding package configuration file is loaded.
When multiple package configuration files are available whose version files
claim compatibility with the version requested it is unspecified which
one is chosen: unless the variable ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER``
is set no attempt is made to choose a highest or closest version number.

To control the order in which ``find_package`` checks for compatibility use
the two variables ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER`` and
``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION``.
For instance in order to select the highest version one can set

 SET(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
 SET(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION DEC)

before calling ``find_package``.

Search Procedure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake constructs a set of possible installation prefixes for the
package.  Under each prefix several directories are searched for a
configuration file.  The tables below show the directories searched.
Each entry is meant for installation trees following Windows (``W``), UNIX
(``U``), or Apple (``A``) conventions::

 <prefix>/                                                       (W)
 <prefix>/(cmake|CMake)/                                         (W)
 <prefix>/<name>*/                                               (W)
 <prefix>/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/                                 (W)
 <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/cmake/<name>*/                 (U)
 <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/                       (U)
 <prefix>/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/         (U)
 <prefix>/<name>*/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/cmake/<name>*/         (W/U)
 <prefix>/<name>*/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/               (W/U)
 <prefix>/<name>*/(lib/<arch>|lib*|share)/<name>*/(cmake|CMake)/ (W/U)

On systems supporting macOS ``FRAMEWORK`` and ``BUNDLE``, the
following directories are searched for Frameworks or Application Bundles
containing a configuration file::

 <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/                    (A)
 <prefix>/<name>.framework/Resources/CMake/              (A)
 <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/         (A)
 <prefix>/<name>.framework/Versions/*/Resources/CMake/   (A)
 <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/                 (A)
 <prefix>/<name>.app/Contents/Resources/CMake/           (A)

In all cases the ``<name>`` is treated as case-insensitive and corresponds
to any of the names specified (``<PackageName>`` or names given by ``NAMES``).

Paths with ``lib/<arch>`` are enabled if the
``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` variable is set. ``lib*`` includes one
or more of the values ``lib64``, ``lib32``, ``libx32`` or ``lib`` (searched in
that order).

* Paths with ``lib64`` are searched on 64 bit platforms if the
  ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS`` property is set to ``TRUE``.
* Paths with ``lib32`` are searched on 32 bit platforms if the
  ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`` property is set to ``TRUE``.
* Paths with ``libx32`` are searched on platforms using the x32 ABI
  if the ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`` property is set to ``TRUE``.
* The ``lib`` path is always searched.

If ``PATH_SUFFIXES`` is specified, the suffixes are appended to each
(``W``) or (``U``) directory entry one-by-one.

This set of directories is intended to work in cooperation with
projects that provide configuration files in their installation trees.
Directories above marked with (``W``) are intended for installations on
Windows where the prefix may point at the top of an application's
installation directory.  Those marked with (``U``) are intended for
installations on UNIX platforms where the prefix is shared by multiple
packages.  This is merely a convention, so all (``W``) and (``U``) directories
are still searched on all platforms.  Directories marked with (``A``) are
intended for installations on Apple platforms.  The
``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and ``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE``
variables determine the order of preference.

The set of installation prefixes is constructed using the following
steps.  If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified all ``NO_*`` options are
enabled.

1. Search paths specified in the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake
   variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable,
   where ``<PackageName>`` is the package to be found.
   The package root variables are maintained as a stack so if
   called from within a find module, root paths from the parent's find
   module will also be searched after paths for the current package.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.
   See policy ``CMP0074``.

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.  These
   are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`semicolon-separated lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH`` to ``FALSE``::

 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``::

 <PackageName>_DIR
 CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
 CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
 CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH

4. Search paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.  These should be paths
   computed by system introspection, such as a hint provided by the
   location of another item already found.  Hard-coded guesses should
   be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.  This can be
   skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed  or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``. Path entries
   ending in ``/bin`` or ``/sbin`` are automatically converted to their
   parent directories::

 PATH

6. Search paths stored in the CMake :ref:`User Package Registry`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is passed or by
   setting the variable ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``
   to ``FALSE`` or the deprecated variable
   ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` to ``TRUE``.

   See the ``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for details on the user
   package registry.

7. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files for the
   current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH`` is
   passed or by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   to ``FALSE``::

 CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
 CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
 CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH

8. Search paths stored in the CMake :ref:`System Package Registry`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is passed
   or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` to ``TRUE``.
   See the ``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for details on the system
   package registry.

9. Search paths specified by the ``PATHS`` option.  These are typically
   hard-coded guesses.

The CMake variable ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` are excluded
from this re-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` is empty.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` are searched, then the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT``
directory is searched, and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE``.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis using options:

``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH``
  Search in the order described above.

``NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Do not use the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` variable.

``ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below
  ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.

The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
least-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the ``NO_*`` options:

 find_package (<PackageName> PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
 find_package (<PackageName>)

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

By default the value stored in the result variable will be the path at
which the file is found.  The ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS``
variable may be set to ``TRUE`` before calling ``find_package`` in order
to resolve symbolic links and store the real path to the file.

Every non-REQUIRED ``find_package`` call can be disabled by setting the
``CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>`` variable to ``TRUE``.

Package File Interface Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When loading a find module or package configuration file ``find_package``
defines variables to provide information about the call arguments (and
restores their original state before returning):

``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME``
  the ``<PackageName>`` which is searched for
``<PackageName>_FIND_REQUIRED``
  true if ``REQUIRED`` option was given
``<PackageName>_FIND_QUIETLY``
  true if ``QUIET`` option was given
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION``
  full requested version string
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``
  major version if requested, else 0
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``
  minor version if requested, else 0
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``
  patch version if requested, else 0
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``
  tweak version if requested, else 0
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``
  number of version components, 0 to 4
``<PackageName>_FIND_VERSION_EXACT``
  true if ``EXACT`` option was given
``<PackageName>_FIND_COMPONENTS``
  list of requested components
``<PackageName>_FIND_REQUIRED_<c>``
  true if component ``<c>`` is required,
  false if component ``<c>`` is optional

In Module mode the loaded find module is responsible to honor the
request detailed by these variables; see the find module for details.
In Config mode ``find_package`` handles ``REQUIRED``, ``QUIET``, and
``[version]`` options automatically but leaves it to the package
configuration file to handle components in a way that makes sense
for the package.  The package configuration file may set
``<PackageName>_FOUND`` to false to tell ``find_package`` that component
requirements are not satisfied.

find_path
---------

A short-hand signature is:

 find_path (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

The general signature is:

 find_path (
           <VAR>
           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...]
           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
           [DOC "cache documentation string"]
           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
           [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
          )

This command is used to find a directory containing the named file.
A cache entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result
of this command.
If the file in a directory is found the result is stored in the variable
and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.
If nothing is found, the result will be
``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, and the search will be attempted again the
next time find_path is invoked with the same variable.

Options include:

``NAMES``
  Specify one or more possible names for the file in a directory.

  When using this to specify names with and without a version
  suffix, we recommend specifying the unversioned name first
  so that locally-built packages can be found before those
  provided by distributions.

``HINTS``, ``PATHS``
  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.
  The ``ENV var`` sub-option reads paths from a system environment
  variable.

``PATH_SUFFIXES``
  Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory
  location otherwise considered.

``DOC``
  Specify the documentation string for the ``<VAR>`` cache entry.

If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified, then no additional paths are
added to the search.
If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is not specified, the search process is as follows:

1. If called from within a find module or any other script loaded by a call to
   ``find_package(<PackageName>)``, search prefixes unique to the
   current package being found.  Specifically, look in the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable.
   The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from
   nested find modules or config packages, root paths from the parent's find
   module or config package will be searched after paths from the current
   module or package.  In other words, the search order would be
   ``<CurrentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<CurrentPackage>_ROOT}``,
   ``<ParentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<ParentPackage>_ROOT}``, etc.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.
   See policy ``CMP0074``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable if called from within a find module loaded by ``find_package(<PackageName>)``

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.
   These are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`semicolon-separated lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or
   by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

4. Search the paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.
   These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
   hint provided by the location of another item already found.
   Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or by
   setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * The directories in ``PATH`` and ``INCLUDE``.
   * On Windows hosts: ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` in ``PATH``, and ``<entry>/include`` for other entries in ``PATH``.

6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
   for the current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   is passed or by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/include/<arch>`` if ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` is set, and ``<prefix>/include`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH``

7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option
   or in the short-hand version of the command.
   These are typically hard-coded guesses.

On macOS the ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variables determine the order of
preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

The CMake variable ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` are excluded
from this re-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` is empty.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` are searched, then the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT``
directory is searched, and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE``.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis using options:

``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH``
  Search in the order described above.

``NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Do not use the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` variable.

``ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below
  ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.

The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
least-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the ``NO_*`` options:

 find_path (<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
 find_path (<VAR> NAMES name)

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

When searching for frameworks, if the file is specified as ``A/b.h``, then
the framework search will look for ``A.framework/Headers/b.h``.  If that
is found the path will be set to the path to the framework.  CMake
will convert this to the correct ``-F`` option to include the file.

find_program
------------

A short-hand signature is:

 find_program (<VAR> name1 [path1 path2 ...])

The general signature is:

 find_program (
           <VAR>
           name | NAMES name1 [name2 ...] [NAMES_PER_DIR]
           [HINTS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATHS path1 [path2 ... ENV var]]
           [PATH_SUFFIXES suffix1 [suffix2 ...]]
           [DOC "cache documentation string"]
           [NO_DEFAULT_PATH]
           [NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
           [NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH]
           [CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH |
            ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH |
            NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH]
          )

This command is used to find a program.
A cache entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result
of this command.
If the program is found the result is stored in the variable
and the search will not be repeated unless the variable is cleared.
If nothing is found, the result will be
``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, and the search will be attempted again the
next time find_program is invoked with the same variable.

Options include:

``NAMES``
  Specify one or more possible names for the program.

  When using this to specify names with and without a version
  suffix, we recommend specifying the unversioned name first
  so that locally-built packages can be found before those
  provided by distributions.

``HINTS``, ``PATHS``
  Specify directories to search in addition to the default locations.
  The ``ENV var`` sub-option reads paths from a system environment
  variable.

``PATH_SUFFIXES``
  Specify additional subdirectories to check below each directory
  location otherwise considered.

``DOC``
  Specify the documentation string for the ``<VAR>`` cache entry.

If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is specified, then no additional paths are
added to the search.
If ``NO_DEFAULT_PATH`` is not specified, the search process is as follows:

1. If called from within a find module or any other script loaded by a call to
   ``find_package(<PackageName>)``, search prefixes unique to the
   current package being found.  Specifically, look in the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the
   ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable.
   The package root variables are maintained as a stack, so if called from
   nested find modules or config packages, root paths from the parent's find
   module or config package will be searched after paths from the current
   module or package.  In other words, the search order would be
   ``<CurrentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<CurrentPackage>_ROOT}``,
   ``<ParentPackage>_ROOT``, ``ENV{<ParentPackage>_ROOT}``, etc.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` is passed or by setting
   the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.
   See policy ``CMP0074``.

   * ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` for each ``<prefix>`` in the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable if called from within a find module loaded by ``find_package(<PackageName>)``

2. Search paths specified in cmake-specific cache variables.
   These are intended to be used on the command line with a ``-DVAR=value``.
   The values are interpreted as :ref:`semicolon-separated lists <CMake Language Lists>`.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` is passed or by setting the
   ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH``

3. Search paths specified in cmake-specific environment variables.
   These are intended to be set in the user's shell configuration,
   and therefore use the host's native path separator
   (``;`` on Windows and ``:`` on UNIX).
   This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or
   by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH``

4. Search the paths specified by the ``HINTS`` option.
   These should be paths computed by system introspection, such as a
   hint provided by the location of another item already found.
   Hard-coded guesses should be specified with the ``PATHS`` option.

5. Search the standard system environment variables.
   This can be skipped if ``NO_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` is passed or by
   setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` to ``FALSE``.

   * The directories in ``PATH`` itself.
   * On Windows hosts no extra search paths are included

6. Search cmake variables defined in the Platform files
   for the current system.  This can be skipped if ``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   is passed or by setting the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``
   to ``FALSE``.

   * ``<prefix>/[s]bin`` for each ``<prefix>`` in ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH``
   * ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH``

7. Search the paths specified by the PATHS option
   or in the short-hand version of the command.
   These are typically hard-coded guesses.

On macOS the ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` and
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variables determine the order of
preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.

The CMake variable ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` specifies one or more
directories to be prepended to all other search directories.  This
effectively "re-roots" the entire search under given locations.
Paths which are descendants of the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` are excluded
from this re-rooting, because that variable is always a path on the host system.
By default the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` is empty.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable can also be used to specify exactly one
directory to use as a prefix.  Setting ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` also has other
effects.  See the documentation for that variable for more.

These variables are especially useful when cross-compiling to
point to the root directory of the target environment and CMake will
search there too.  By default at first the directories listed in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` are searched, then the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT``
directory is searched, and then the non-rooted directories will be
searched.  The default behavior can be adjusted by setting
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM``.  This behavior can be manually
overridden on a per-call basis using options:

``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_BOTH``
  Search in the order described above.

``NO_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Do not use the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` variable.

``ONLY_CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
  Search only the re-rooted directories and directories below
  ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.

The default search order is designed to be most-specific to
least-specific for common use cases.
Projects may override the order by simply calling the command
multiple times and using the ``NO_*`` options:

 find_program (<VAR> NAMES name PATHS paths... NO_DEFAULT_PATH)
 find_program (<VAR> NAMES name)

Once one of the calls succeeds the result variable will be set
and stored in the cache so that no call will search again.

When more than one value is given to the ``NAMES`` option this command by
default will consider one name at a time and search every directory
for it.  The ``NAMES_PER_DIR`` option tells this command to consider one
directory at a time and search for all names in it.

foreach
-------

Evaluate a group of commands for each value in a list.

 foreach(<loop_var> <items>)
   <commands>
 endforeach()

where ``<items>`` is a list of items that are separated by
semicolon or whitespace.
All commands between ``foreach`` and the matching ``endforeach`` are recorded
without being invoked.  Once the ``endforeach`` is evaluated, the recorded
list of commands is invoked once for each item in ``<items>``.
At the beginning of each iteration the variable ``loop_var`` will be set
to the value of the current item.

The commands ``break()`` and ``continue()`` provide means to
escape from the normal control flow.

Per legacy, the ``endforeach()`` command admits
an optional ``<loop_var>`` argument.
If used, it must be a verbatim
repeat of the argument of the opening
``foreach`` command.

 foreach(<loop_var> RANGE <stop>)

In this variant, ``foreach`` iterates over the numbers
0, 1, ... up to (and including) the nonnegative integer ``<stop>``.

 foreach(<loop_var> RANGE <start> <stop> [<step>])

In this variant, ``foreach`` iterates over the numbers from
``<start>`` up to at most ``<stop>`` in steps of ``<step>``.
If ``<step>`` is not specified, then the step size is 1.
The three arguments ``<start>`` ``<stop>`` ``<step>`` must
all be nonnegative integers, and ``<stop>`` must not be
smaller than ``<start>``; otherwise you enter the danger zone
of undocumented behavior that may change in future releases.

 foreach(loop_var IN [LISTS [<lists>]] [ITEMS [<items>]])

In this variant, ``<lists>`` is a whitespace or semicolon
separated list of list-valued variables. The ``foreach``
command iterates over each item in each given list.
The ``<items>`` following the ``ITEMS`` keyword are processed
as in the first variant of the ``foreach`` command.
The forms ``LISTS A`` and ``ITEMS ${A}`` are
equivalent.

The following example shows how the ``LISTS`` option is
processed:

 set(A 0;1)
 set(B 2 3)
 set(C "4 5")
 set(D 6;7 8)
 set(E "")
 foreach(X IN LISTS A B C D E)
     message(STATUS "X=${X}")
 endforeach()

yields
::

 -- X=0
 -- X=1
 -- X=2
 -- X=3
 -- X=4 5
 -- X=6
 -- X=7
 -- X=8

function
--------

Start recording a function for later invocation as a command.

 function(<name> [<arg1> ...])
   <commands>
 endfunction()

Defines a function named ``<name>`` that takes arguments named
``<arg1>``, ...  The ``<commands>`` in the function definition
are recorded; they are not executed until the function is invoked.

Per legacy, the ``endfunction()`` command admits an optional
``<name>`` argument. If used, it must be a verbatim repeat of the
argument of the opening ``function`` command.

A function opens a new scope: see ``set(var PARENT_SCOPE)`` for
details.

See the ``cmake_policy()`` command documentation for the behavior
of policies inside functions.

See the ``macro()`` command documentation for differences
between CMake functions and macros.

Invocation
^^^^^^^^^^

The function invocation is case-insensitive. A function defined as

 function(foo)
   <commands>
 endfunction()

can be invoked through any of

 foo()
 Foo()
 FOO()

and so on. However, it is strongly recommended to stay with the
case chosen in the function definition. Typically functions use
all-lowercase names.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

When the function is invoked, the recorded ``<commands>`` are first
modified by replacing formal parameters (``${arg1}``, ...) with the
arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands.

In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the
``ARGC`` variable which will be set to the number of arguments passed
into the function as well as ``ARGV0``, ``ARGV1``, ``ARGV2``, ...  which
will have the actual values of the arguments passed in.  This facilitates
creating functions with optional arguments.

Furthermore, ``ARGV`` holds the list of all arguments given to the
function and ``ARGN`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected
argument.  Referencing to ``ARGV#`` arguments beyond ``ARGC`` have
undefined behavior.  Checking that ``ARGC`` is greater than ``#`` is
the only way to ensure that ``ARGV#`` was passed to the function as an
extra argument.

get_cmake_property
------------------

Get a global property of the CMake instance.

 get_cmake_property(<var> <property>)

Gets a global property from the CMake instance.  The value of
the ``<property>`` is stored in the variable ``<var>``.
If the property is not found, ``<var>`` will be set to ``NOTFOUND``.
See the ``cmake-properties(7)`` manual for available properties.

See also the ``get_property()`` command ``GLOBAL`` option.

In addition to global properties, this command (for historical reasons)
also supports the ``VARIABLES`` and ``MACROS`` directory
properties.  It also supports a special ``COMPONENTS`` global property that
lists the components given to the ``install()`` command.

get_directory_property
----------------------

Get a property of ``DIRECTORY`` scope.

 get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>] <prop-name>)

Stores a property of directory scope in the named ``<variable>``.
The ``DIRECTORY`` argument specifies another directory from which
to retrieve the property value instead of the current directory.
The specified directory must have already been traversed by CMake.

If the property is not defined for the nominated directory scope,
an empty string is returned.  In the case of ``INHERITED`` properties,
if the property is not found for the nominated directory scope,
the search will chain to a parent scope as described for the
``define_property()`` command.

 get_directory_property(<variable> [DIRECTORY <dir>]
                        DEFINITION <var-name>)

Get a variable definition from a directory.  This form is useful to
get a variable definition from another directory.

See also the more general ``get_property()`` command.

get_filename_component
----------------------

Get a specific component of a full filename.

 get_filename_component(<var> <FileName> <mode> [CACHE])

Sets ``<var>`` to a component of ``<FileName>``, where ``<mode>`` is one of:

::

 DIRECTORY = Directory without file name
 NAME      = File name without directory
 EXT       = File name longest extension (.b.c from d/a.b.c)
 NAME_WE   = File name without directory or longest extension
 LAST_EXT  = File name last extension (.c from d/a.b.c)
 NAME_WLE  = File name without directory or last extension
 PATH      = Legacy alias for DIRECTORY (use for CMake <= 2.8.11)

Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slashes.
If the optional ``CACHE`` argument is specified, the result variable is
added to the cache.

 get_filename_component(<var> <FileName> <mode> [BASE_DIR <dir>] [CACHE])

Sets ``<var>`` to the absolute path of ``<FileName>``, where ``<mode>`` is one
of:

::

 ABSOLUTE  = Full path to file
 REALPATH  = Full path to existing file with symlinks resolved

If the provided ``<FileName>`` is a relative path, it is evaluated relative
to the given base directory ``<dir>``.  If no base directory is
provided, the default base directory will be
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``.

Paths are returned with forward slashes and have no trailing slashes.  If the
optional ``CACHE`` argument is specified, the result variable is added to the
cache.

 get_filename_component(<var> <FileName> PROGRAM [PROGRAM_ARGS <arg_var>] [CACHE])

The program in ``<FileName>`` will be found in the system search path or
left as a full path.  If ``PROGRAM_ARGS`` is present with ``PROGRAM``, then
any command-line arguments present in the ``<FileName>`` string are split
from the program name and stored in ``<arg_var>``.  This is used to
separate a program name from its arguments in a command line string.

get_property
------------

Get a property.

 get_property(<variable>
              <GLOBAL             |
               DIRECTORY [<dir>]  |
               TARGET    <target> |
               SOURCE    <source> |
               INSTALL   <file>   |
               TEST      <test>   |
               CACHE     <entry>  |
               VARIABLE           >
              PROPERTY <name>
              [SET | DEFINED | BRIEF_DOCS | FULL_DOCS])

Gets one property from one object in a scope.

The first argument specifies the variable in which to store the result.
The second argument determines the scope from which to get the property.
It must be one of the following:

``GLOBAL``
  Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

``DIRECTORY``
  Scope defaults to the current directory but another
  directory (already processed by CMake) may be named by the
  full or relative path ``<dir>``.

``TARGET``
  Scope must name one existing target.

``SOURCE``
  Scope must name one source file.

``INSTALL``
  Scope must name one installed file path.

``TEST``
  Scope must name one existing test.

``CACHE``
  Scope must name one cache entry.

``VARIABLE``
  Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of
the property to get.  If the property is not set an empty value is
returned, although some properties support inheriting from a parent scope
if defined to behave that way (see ``define_property()``).

If the ``SET`` option is given the variable is set to a boolean
value indicating whether the property has been set.  If the ``DEFINED``
option is given the variable is set to a boolean value indicating
whether the property has been defined such as with the
``define_property()`` command.

If ``BRIEF_DOCS`` or ``FULL_DOCS`` is given then the variable is set to a
string containing documentation for the requested property.  If
documentation is requested for a property that has not been defined
``NOTFOUND`` is returned.

if
--

Conditionally execute a group of commands.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

 if(<condition>)
   <commands>
 elseif(<condition>) # optional block, can be repeated
   <commands>
 else()              # optional block
   <commands>
 endif()

Evaluates the ``condition`` argument of the ``if`` clause according to the
Condition syntax described below. If the result is true, then the
``commands`` in the ``if`` block are executed.
Otherwise, optional ``elseif`` blocks are processed in the same way.
Finally, if no ``condition`` is true, ``commands`` in the optional ``else``
block are executed.

Per legacy, the ``else()`` and ``endif()`` commands admit
an optional ``<condition>`` argument.
If used, it must be a verbatim
repeat of the argument of the opening
``if`` command.

Condition Syntax
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following syntax applies to the ``condition`` argument of
the ``if``, ``elseif`` and ``while()`` clauses.

Compound conditions are evaluated in the following order of precedence:
Innermost parentheses are evaluated first. Next come unary tests such
as ``EXISTS``, ``COMMAND``, and ``DEFINED``.  Then binary tests such as
``EQUAL``, ``LESS``, ``LESS_EQUAL``, ``GREATER``, ``GREATER_EQUAL``,
``STREQUAL``, ``STRLESS``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, ``STRGREATER``,
``STRGREATER_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS``,
``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_GREATER``, ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``,
and ``MATCHES``.  Then the boolean operators in the order ``NOT``,  ``AND``,
and finally ``OR``.

Possible conditions are:

``if(<constant>)``
 True if the constant is ``1``, ``ON``, ``YES``, ``TRUE``, ``Y``,
 or a non-zero number.  False if the constant is ``0``, ``OFF``,
 ``NO``, ``FALSE``, ``N``, ``IGNORE``, ``NOTFOUND``, the empty string,
 or ends in the suffix ``-NOTFOUND``.  Named boolean constants are
 case-insensitive.  If the argument is not one of these specific
 constants, it is treated as a variable or string and the following
 signature is used.

``if(<variable|string>)``
 True if given a variable that is defined to a value that is not a false
 constant.  False otherwise.  (Note macro arguments are not variables.)

``if(NOT <condition>)``
 True if the condition is not true.

``if(<cond1> AND <cond2>)``
 True if both conditions would be considered true individually.

``if(<cond1> OR <cond2>)``
 True if either condition would be considered true individually.

``if(COMMAND command-name)``
 True if the given name is a command, macro or function that can be
 invoked.

``if(POLICY policy-id)``
 True if the given name is an existing policy (of the form ``CMP<NNNN>``).

``if(TARGET target-name)``
 True if the given name is an existing logical target name created
 by a call to the ``add_executable()``, ``add_library()``,
 or ``add_custom_target()`` command that has already been invoked
 (in any directory).

``if(TEST test-name)``
 True if the given name is an existing test name created by the
 ``add_test()`` command.

``if(EXISTS path-to-file-or-directory)``
 True if the named file or directory exists.  Behavior is well-defined
 only for full paths. Resolves symbolic links, i.e. if the named file or
 directory is a symbolic link, returns true if the target of the
 symbolic link exists.

``if(file1 IS_NEWER_THAN file2)``
 True if ``file1`` is newer than ``file2`` or if one of the two files doesn't
 exist.  Behavior is well-defined only for full paths.  If the file
 time stamps are exactly the same, an ``IS_NEWER_THAN`` comparison returns
 true, so that any dependent build operations will occur in the event
 of a tie.  This includes the case of passing the same file name for
 both file1 and file2.

``if(IS_DIRECTORY path-to-directory)``
 True if the given name is a directory.  Behavior is well-defined only
 for full paths.

``if(IS_SYMLINK file-name)``
 True if the given name is a symbolic link.  Behavior is well-defined
 only for full paths.

``if(IS_ABSOLUTE path)``
 True if the given path is an absolute path.

``if(<variable|string> MATCHES regex)``
 True if the given string or variable's value matches the given regular
 condition.  See :ref:`Regex Specification` for regex format.
 ``()`` groups are captured in ``CMAKE_MATCH_<n>`` variables.

``if(<variable|string> LESS <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and less
 than that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> GREATER <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and greater
 than that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and equal
 to that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> LESS_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and less
 than or equal to that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> GREATER_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is a valid number and greater
 than or equal to that on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRLESS <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less
 than the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRGREATER <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically greater
 than the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STREQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically equal
 to the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRLESS_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically less
 than or equal to the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> STRGREATER_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 True if the given string or variable's value is lexicographically greater
 than or equal to the string or variable on the right.

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_LESS <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``, omitted components are treated as zero).
 Any non-integer version component or non-integer trailing part of a version
 component effectively truncates the string at that point.

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_GREATER <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``, omitted components are treated as zero).
 Any non-integer version component or non-integer trailing part of a version
 component effectively truncates the string at that point.

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``, omitted components are treated as zero).
 Any non-integer version component or non-integer trailing part of a version
 component effectively truncates the string at that point.

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_LESS_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``, omitted components are treated as zero).
 Any non-integer version component or non-integer trailing part of a version
 component effectively truncates the string at that point.

``if(<variable|string> VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL <variable|string>)``
 Component-wise integer version number comparison (version format is
 ``major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]``, omitted components are treated as zero).
 Any non-integer version component or non-integer trailing part of a version
 component effectively truncates the string at that point.

``if(<variable|string> IN_LIST <variable>)``
 True if the given element is contained in the named list variable.

``if(DEFINED <name>|CACHE{<name>}|ENV{<name>})``
 True if a variable, cache variable or environment variable
 with given ``<name>`` is defined. The value of the variable
 does not matter. Note that macro arguments are not variables.

``if((condition) AND (condition OR (condition)))``
 The conditions inside the parenthesis are evaluated first and then
 the remaining condition is evaluated as in the previous examples.
 Where there are nested parenthesis the innermost are evaluated as part
 of evaluating the condition that contains them.

Variable Expansion
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The if command was written very early in CMake's history, predating
the ``${}`` variable evaluation syntax, and for convenience evaluates
variables named by its arguments as shown in the above signatures.
Note that normal variable evaluation with ``${}`` applies before the if
command even receives the arguments.  Therefore code like

 set(var1 OFF)
 set(var2 "var1")
 if(${var2})

appears to the if command as

 if(var1)

and is evaluated according to the ``if(<variable>)`` case documented
above.  The result is ``OFF`` which is false.  However, if we remove the
``${}`` from the example then the command sees

 if(var2)

which is true because ``var2`` is defined to ``var1`` which is not a false
constant.

Automatic evaluation applies in the other cases whenever the
above-documented condition syntax accepts ``<variable|string>``:

* The left hand argument to ``MATCHES`` is first checked to see if it is
  a defined variable, if so the variable's value is used, otherwise the
  original value is used.

* If the left hand argument to ``MATCHES`` is missing it returns false
  without error

* Both left and right hand arguments to ``LESS``, ``GREATER``, ``EQUAL``,
  ``LESS_EQUAL``, and ``GREATER_EQUAL``, are independently tested to see if
  they are defined variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise
  the original value is used.

* Both left and right hand arguments to ``STRLESS``, ``STRGREATER``,
  ``STREQUAL``, ``STRLESS_EQUAL``, and ``STRGREATER_EQUAL`` are independently
  tested to see if they are defined variables, if so their defined values are
  used otherwise the original value is used.

* Both left and right hand arguments to ``VERSION_LESS``,
  ``VERSION_GREATER``, ``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, and
  ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL`` are independently tested to see if they are defined
  variables, if so their defined values are used otherwise the original value
  is used.

* The right hand argument to ``NOT`` is tested to see if it is a boolean
  constant, if so the value is used, otherwise it is assumed to be a
  variable and it is dereferenced.

* The left and right hand arguments to ``AND`` and ``OR`` are independently
  tested to see if they are boolean constants, if so they are used as
  such, otherwise they are assumed to be variables and are dereferenced.

To prevent ambiguity, potential variable or keyword names can be
specified in a :ref:`Quoted Argument` or a :ref:`Bracket Argument`.
A quoted or bracketed variable or keyword will be interpreted as a
string and not dereferenced or interpreted.
See policy ``CMP0054``.

There is no automatic evaluation for environment or cache
:ref:`Variable References`.  Their values must be referenced as
``$ENV{<name>}`` or ``$CACHE{<name>}`` wherever the above-documented
condition syntax accepts ``<variable|string>``.

include
-------

Load and run CMake code from a file or module.

 include(<file|module> [OPTIONAL] [RESULT_VARIABLE <var>]
                       [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

Loads and runs CMake code from the file given.  Variable reads and
writes access the scope of the caller (dynamic scoping).  If ``OPTIONAL``
is present, then no error is raised if the file does not exist.  If
``RESULT_VARIABLE`` is given the variable ``<var>`` will be set to the
full filename which has been included or ``NOTFOUND`` if it failed.

If a module is specified instead of a file, the file with name
``<modulename>.cmake`` is searched first in ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``,
then in the CMake module directory.  There is one exception to this: if
the file which calls ``include()`` is located itself in the CMake builtin
module directory, then first the CMake builtin module directory is searched and
``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` afterwards.  See also policy ``CMP0017``.

See the ``cmake_policy()`` command documentation for discussion of the
``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option.

include_guard
-------------

Provides an include guard for the file currently being processed by CMake.

 include_guard([DIRECTORY|GLOBAL])

Sets up an include guard for the current CMake file (see the
``CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE`` variable documentation).

CMake will end its processing of the current file at the location of the
``include_guard()`` command if the current file has already been
processed for the applicable scope (see below). This provides functionality
similar to the include guards commonly used in source headers or to the
``#pragma once`` directive. If the current file has been processed previously
for the applicable scope, the effect is as though ``return()`` had been
called. Do not call this command from inside a function being defined within
the current file.

An optional argument specifying the scope of the guard may be provided.
Possible values for the option are:

``DIRECTORY``
  The include guard applies within the current directory and below. The file
  will only be included once within this directory scope, but may be included
  again by other files outside of this directory (i.e. a parent directory or
  another directory not pulled in by ``add_subdirectory()`` or
  ``include()`` from the current file or its children).

``GLOBAL``
  The include guard applies globally to the whole build. The current file
  will only be included once regardless of the scope.

If no arguments given, ``include_guard`` has the same scope as a variable,
meaning that the include guard effect is isolated by the most recent
function scope or current directory if no inner function scopes exist.
In this case the command behavior is the same as:

 if(__CURRENT_FILE_VAR__)
   return()
 endif()
 set(__CURRENT_FILE_VAR__ TRUE)

list
----

List operations.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

 Reading
   list(LENGTH <list> <out-var>)
   list(GET <list> <element index> [<index> ...] <out-var>)
   list(JOIN <list> <glue> <out-var>)
   list(SUBLIST <list> <begin> <length> <out-var>)

   list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)
   list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> [...])

 Ordering
   list(REVERSE <list>)
   list(SORT <list> [...])

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The list subcommands ``APPEND``, ``INSERT``, ``FILTER``, ``PREPEND``,
``POP_BACK``, ``POP_FRONT``, ``REMOVE_AT``, ``REMOVE_ITEM``,
``REMOVE_DUPLICATES``, ``REVERSE`` and ``SORT`` may create
new values for the list within the current CMake variable scope.  Similar to
the ``set()`` command, the LIST command creates new variable values in
the current scope, even if the list itself is actually defined in a parent
scope.  To propagate the results of these operations upwards, use
``set()`` with ``PARENT_SCOPE``, ``set()`` with
``CACHE INTERNAL``, or some other means of value propagation.

.. note::

  A list in cmake is a ``;`` separated group of strings.  To create a
  list the set command can be used.  For example, ``set(var a b c d e)``
  creates a list with ``a;b;c;d;e``, and ``set(var "a b c d e")`` creates a
  string or a list with one item in it.   (Note macro arguments are not
  variables, and therefore cannot be used in LIST commands.)

.. note::

  When specifying index values, if ``<element index>`` is 0 or greater, it
  is indexed from the beginning of the list, with 0 representing the
  first list element.  If ``<element index>`` is -1 or lesser, it is indexed
  from the end of the list, with -1 representing the last list element.
  Be careful when counting with negative indices: they do not start from
  0.  -0 is equivalent to 0, the first list element.

Reading
^^^^^^^

 list(LENGTH <list> <output variable>)

Returns the list's length.

 list(GET <list> <element index> [<element index> ...] <output variable>)

Returns the list of elements specified by indices from the list.

 list(JOIN <list> <glue> <output variable>)

Returns a string joining all list's elements using the glue string.
To join multiple strings, which are not part of a list, use ``JOIN`` operator
from ``string()`` command.

 list(SUBLIST <list> <begin> <length> <output variable>)

Returns a sublist of the given list.
If ``<length>`` is 0, an empty list will be returned.
If ``<length>`` is -1 or the list is smaller than ``<begin>+<length>`` then
the remaining elements of the list starting at ``<begin>`` will be returned.

Search
^^^^^^

 list(FIND <list> <value> <output variable>)

Returns the index of the element specified in the list or -1
if it wasn't found.

Modification
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 list(APPEND <list> [<element> ...])

Appends elements to the list.

 list(FILTER <list> <INCLUDE|EXCLUDE> REGEX <regular_expression>)

Includes or removes items from the list that match the mode's pattern.
In ``REGEX`` mode, items will be matched against the given regular expression.

For more information on regular expressions see also the
``string()`` command.

 list(INSERT <list> <element_index> <element> [<element> ...])

Inserts elements to the list to the specified location.

 list(POP_BACK <list> [<out-var>...])

If no variable name is given, removes exactly one element. Otherwise,
assign the last element's value to the given variable and removes it,
up to the last variable name given.

 list(POP_FRONT <list> [<out-var>...])

If no variable name is given, removes exactly one element. Otherwise,
assign the first element's value to the given variable and removes it,
up to the last variable name given.

 list(PREPEND <list> [<element> ...])

Insert elements to the 0th position in the list.

 list(REMOVE_ITEM <list> <value> [<value> ...])

Removes the given items from the list.

 list(REMOVE_AT <list> <index> [<index> ...])

Removes items at given indices from the list.

 list(REMOVE_DUPLICATES <list>)

Removes duplicated items in the list. The relative order of items is preserved,
but if duplicates are encountered, only the first instance is preserved.

 list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> [<SELECTOR>]
                       [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output variable>])

Transforms the list by applying an action to all or, by specifying a
``<SELECTOR>``, to the selected elements of the list, storing the result
in-place or in the specified output variable.

.. note::

   The ``TRANSFORM`` sub-command does not change the number of elements in the
   list. If a ``<SELECTOR>`` is specified, only some elements will be changed,
   the other ones will remain the same as before the transformation.

``<ACTION>`` specifies the action to apply to the elements of the list.
The actions have exactly the same semantics as sub-commands of the
``string()`` command.  ``<ACTION>`` must be one of the following:

``APPEND``, ``PREPEND``: Append, prepend specified value to each element of
the list.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <APPEND|PREPEND> <value> ...)

``TOUPPER``, ``TOLOWER``: Convert each element of the list to upper, lower
characters.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <TOLOWER|TOUPPER> ...)

``STRIP``: Remove leading and trailing spaces from each element of the
list.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> STRIP ...)

``GENEX_STRIP``: Strip any
``generator expressions`` from each
element of the list.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> GENEX_STRIP ...)

``REPLACE``: Match the regular expression as many times as possible and
substitute the replacement expression for the match for each element
of the list
(Same semantic as ``REGEX REPLACE`` from ``string()`` command).

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> REPLACE <regular_expression>
                                  <replace_expression> ...)

``<SELECTOR>`` determines which elements of the list will be transformed.
Only one type of selector can be specified at a time.  When given,
``<SELECTOR>`` must be one of the following:

``AT``: Specify a list of indexes.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> AT <index> [<index> ...] ...)

``FOR``: Specify a range with, optionally, an increment used to iterate over
the range.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> FOR <start> <stop> [<step>] ...)

``REGEX``: Specify a regular expression. Only elements matching the regular
expression will be transformed.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    list(TRANSFORM <list> <ACTION> REGEX <regular_expression> ...)


Ordering
^^^^^^^^

 list(REVERSE <list>)

Reverses the contents of the list in-place.

 list(SORT <list> [COMPARE <compare>] [CASE <case>] [ORDER <order>])

Sorts the list in-place alphabetically.
Use the ``COMPARE`` keyword to select the comparison method for sorting.
The ``<compare>`` option should be one of:

* ``STRING``: Sorts a list of strings alphabetically.  This is the
  default behavior if the ``COMPARE`` option is not given.
* ``FILE_BASENAME``: Sorts a list of pathnames of files by their basenames.

Use the ``CASE`` keyword to select a case sensitive or case insensitive
sort mode.  The ``<case>`` option should be one of:

* ``SENSITIVE``: List items are sorted in a case-sensitive manner.  This is
  the default behavior if the ``CASE`` option is not given.
* ``INSENSITIVE``: List items are sorted case insensitively.  The order of
  items which differ only by upper/lowercase is not specified.

To control the sort order, the ``ORDER`` keyword can be given.
The ``<order>`` option should be one of:

* ``ASCENDING``: Sorts the list in ascending order.  This is the default
  behavior when the ``ORDER`` option is not given.
* ``DESCENDING``: Sorts the list in descending order.

macro
-----

Start recording a macro for later invocation as a command

 macro(<name> [<arg1> ...])
   <commands>
 endmacro()

Defines a macro named ``<name>`` that takes arguments named
``<arg1>``, ... Commands listed after macro, but before the
matching ``endmacro()``, are not executed until the macro
is invoked.

Per legacy, the ``endmacro()`` command admits an optional
``<name>`` argument. If used, it must be a verbatim repeat of the
argument of the opening ``macro`` command.

See the ``cmake_policy()`` command documentation for the behavior
of policies inside macros.

See the :ref:`Macro vs Function` section below for differences
between CMake macros and ``functions``.

Invocation
^^^^^^^^^^

The macro invocation is case-insensitive. A macro defined as

 macro(foo)
   <commands>
 endmacro()

can be invoked through any of

 foo()
 Foo()
 FOO()

and so on. However, it is strongly recommended to stay with the
case chosen in the macro definition.  Typically macros use
all-lowercase names.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

When a macro is invoked, the commands recorded in the macro are
first modified by replacing formal parameters (``${arg1}``, ...)
with the arguments passed, and then invoked as normal commands.

In addition to referencing the formal parameters you can reference the
values ``${ARGC}`` which will be set to the number of arguments passed
into the function as well as ``${ARGV0}``, ``${ARGV1}``, ``${ARGV2}``,
...  which will have the actual values of the arguments passed in.
This facilitates creating macros with optional arguments.

Furthermore, ``${ARGV}`` holds the list of all arguments given to the
macro and ``${ARGN}`` holds the list of arguments past the last expected
argument.
Referencing to ``${ARGV#}`` arguments beyond ``${ARGC}`` have undefined
behavior. Checking that ``${ARGC}`` is greater than ``#`` is the only
way to ensure that ``${ARGV#}`` was passed to the function as an extra
argument.

Macro vs Function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``macro`` command is very similar to the ``function()`` command.
Nonetheless, there are a few important differences.

In a function, ``ARGN``, ``ARGC``, ``ARGV`` and ``ARGV0``, ``ARGV1``, ...
are true variables in the usual CMake sense.  In a macro, they are not,
they are string replacements much like the C preprocessor would do
with a macro.  This has a number of consequences, as explained in
the :ref:`Argument Caveats` section below.

Another difference between macros and functions is the control flow.
A function is executed by transferring control from the calling
statement to the function body.  A macro is executed as if the macro
body were pasted in place of the calling statement.  This has the
consequence that a ``return()`` in a macro body does not
just terminate execution of the macro; rather, control is returned
from the scope of the macro call.  To avoid confusion, it is recommended
to avoid ``return()`` in macros altogether.

Argument Caveats
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since ``ARGN``, ``ARGC``, ``ARGV``, ``ARGV0`` etc. are not variables,
you will NOT be able to use commands like

 if(ARGV1) # ARGV1 is not a variable
 if(DEFINED ARGV2) # ARGV2 is not a variable
 if(ARGC GREATER 2) # ARGC is not a variable
 foreach(loop_var IN LISTS ARGN) # ARGN is not a variable

In the first case, you can use ``if(${ARGV1})``.  In the second and
third case, the proper way to check if an optional variable was
passed to the macro is to use ``if(${ARGC} GREATER 2)``.  In the
last case, you can use ``foreach(loop_var ${ARGN})`` but this will
skip empty arguments.  If you need to include them, you can use

 set(list_var "${ARGN}")
 foreach(loop_var IN LISTS list_var)

Note that if you have a variable with the same name in the scope from
which the macro is called, using unreferenced names will use the
existing variable instead of the arguments. For example:

 macro(bar)
   foreach(arg IN LISTS ARGN)
     <commands>
   endforeach()
 endmacro()

 function(foo)
   bar(x y z)
 endfunction()

 foo(a b c)

Will loop over ``a;b;c`` and not over ``x;y;z`` as one might have expected.
If you want true CMake variables and/or better CMake scope control you
should look at the function command.

mark_as_advanced
----------------

Mark cmake cached variables as advanced.

 mark_as_advanced([CLEAR|FORCE] <var1> ...)

Sets the advanced/non-advanced state of the named
cached variables.

An advanced variable will not be displayed in any
of the cmake GUIs unless the ``show advanced`` option is on.
In script mode, the advanced/non-advanced state has no effect.

If the keyword ``CLEAR`` is given
then advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.
If the keyword ``FORCE`` is given
then the variables are made advanced.
If neither ``FORCE`` nor ``CLEAR`` is specified,
new values will be marked as advanced, but if a
variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state,
it will not be changed.

math
----

Evaluate a mathematical expression.

 math(EXPR <variable> "<expression>" [OUTPUT_FORMAT <format>])

Evaluates a mathematical ``<expression>`` and sets ``<variable>`` to the
resulting value.  The result of the expression must be representable as a
64-bit signed integer.

The mathematical expression must be given as a string (i.e. enclosed in
double quotation marks). An example is ``"5 * (10 + 13)"``.
Supported operators are ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``/``, ``%``, ``|``, ``&``,
``^``, ``~``, ``<<``, ``>>``, and ``(...)``; they have the same meaning
as in C code.

Hexadecimal numbers are recognized when prefixed with ``0x``, as in C code.

The result is formatted according to the option ``OUTPUT_FORMAT``,
where ``<format>`` is one of

``HEXADECIMAL``
  Hexadecimal notation as in C code, i. e. starting with "0x".
``DECIMAL``
  Decimal notation. Which is also used if no ``OUTPUT_FORMAT`` option
  is specified.


For example

 math(EXPR value "100 * 0xA" OUTPUT_FORMAT DECIMAL)      # value is set to "1000"
 math(EXPR value "100 * 0xA" OUTPUT_FORMAT HEXADECIMAL)  # value is set to "0x3e8"

message
-------

Display a message to the user.

 message([<mode>] "message to display" ...)

The optional ``<mode>`` keyword determines the type of message:

``FATAL_ERROR``
  CMake Error, stop processing and generation.

``SEND_ERROR``
  CMake Error, continue processing, but skip generation.

``WARNING``
  CMake Warning, continue processing.

``AUTHOR_WARNING``
  CMake Warning (dev), continue processing.

``DEPRECATION``
  CMake Deprecation Error or Warning if variable
  ``CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED`` or ``CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED``
  is enabled, respectively, else no message.

(none) or ``NOTICE``
  Important message printed to stderr to attract user's attention.

``STATUS``
  The main interesting messages that project users might be interested in.
  Ideally these should be concise, no more than a single line, but still
  informative.

``VERBOSE``
  Detailed informational messages intended for project users.  These messages
  should provide additional details that won't be of interest in most cases,
  but which may be useful to those building the project when they want deeper
  insight into what's happening.

``DEBUG``
  Detailed informational messages intended for developers working on the
  project itself as opposed to users who just want to build it.  These messages
  will not typically be of interest to other users building the project and
  will often be closely related to internal implementation details.

``TRACE``
  Fine-grained messages with very low-level implementation details.  Messages
  using this log level would normally only be temporary and would expect to be
  removed before releasing the project, packaging up the files, etc.

The CMake command-line tool displays ``STATUS`` to ``TRACE`` messages on stdout
with the message preceded by two hyphens and a space.  All other message types
are sent to stderr and are not prefixed with hyphens.  The
``CMake GUI`` displays all messages in its log area.
The ``curses interface`` shows ``STATUS`` to ``TRACE``
messages one at a time on a status line and other messages in an
interactive pop-up box.  The ``--log-level`` command-line option to each of
these tools can be used to control which messages will be shown.

Messages of log levels ``NOTICE`` and below will also have each line preceded
by the content of the ``CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT`` variable (converted to
a single string by concatenating its list items).  For ``STATUS`` to ``TRACE``
messages, this indenting content will be inserted after the hyphens.

CMake Warning and Error message text displays using a simple markup
language.  Non-indented text is formatted in line-wrapped paragraphs
delimited by newlines.  Indented text is considered pre-formatted.

option
------

Provide an option that the user can optionally select.

 option(<variable> "<help_text>" [value])

Provides an option for the user to select as ``ON`` or ``OFF``.
If no initial ``<value>`` is provided, ``OFF`` is used.
If ``<variable>`` is already set as a normal variable
then the command does nothing (see policy ``CMP0077``).

If you have options that depend on the values of other options, see
the module help for ``CMakeDependentOption``.

return
------

Return from a file, directory or function.

 return()

Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is
encountered in an included file (via ``include()`` or
``find_package()``), it causes processing of the current file to stop
and control is returned to the including file.  If it is encountered in a
file which is not included by another file, e.g.  a ``CMakeLists.txt``,
control is returned to the parent directory if there is one.  If return is
called in a function, control is returned to the caller of the function.

Note that a ``macro``, unlike a ``function``,
is expanded in place and therefore cannot handle ``return()``.

separate_arguments
------------------

Parse command-line arguments into a semicolon-separated list.

 separate_arguments(<variable> <mode> <args>)

Parses a space-separated string ``<args>`` into a list of items,
and stores this list in semicolon-separated standard form in ``<variable>``.

This function is intended for parsing command-line arguments.
The entire command line must be passed as one string in the
argument ``<args>``.

The exact parsing rules depend on the operating system.
They are specified by the ``<mode>`` argument which must
be one of the following keywords:

``UNIX_COMMAND``
  Arguments are separated by by unquoted whitespace.
  Both single-quote and double-quote pairs are respected.
  A backslash escapes the next literal character (``\"`` is ``"``);
  there are no special escapes (``\n`` is just ``n``).

``WINDOWS_COMMAND``
  A Windows command-line is parsed using the same
  syntax the runtime library uses to construct argv at startup.  It
  separates arguments by whitespace that is not double-quoted.
  Backslashes are literal unless they precede double-quotes.  See the
  MSDN article Parsing C Command-Line Arguments for details.

``NATIVE_COMMAND``
  Proceeds as in ``WINDOWS_COMMAND`` mode if the host system is Windows.
  Otherwise proceeds as in ``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode.

 separate_arguments(<var>)

Convert the value of ``<var>`` to a semi-colon separated list.  All
spaces are replaced with ';'.  This helps with generating command
lines.

set
---

Set a normal, cache, or environment variable to a given value.
See the :ref:`cmake-language(7) variables <CMake Language Variables>`
documentation for the scopes and interaction of normal variables
and cache entries.

Signatures of this command that specify a ``<value>...`` placeholder
expect zero or more arguments.  Multiple arguments will be joined as
a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` to form the actual variable
value to be set.  Zero arguments will cause normal variables to be
unset.  See the ``unset()`` command to unset variables explicitly.

Set Normal Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 set(<variable> <value>... [PARENT_SCOPE])

Sets the given ``<variable>`` in the current function or directory scope.

If the ``PARENT_SCOPE`` option is given the variable will be set in
the scope above the current scope.  Each new directory or function
creates a new scope.  This command will set the value of a variable
into the parent directory or calling function (whichever is applicable
to the case at hand). The previous state of the variable's value stays the
same in the current scope (e.g., if it was undefined before, it is still
undefined and if it had a value, it is still that value).

Set Cache Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 set(<variable> <value>... CACHE <type> <docstring> [FORCE])

Sets the given cache ``<variable>`` (cache entry).  Since cache entries
are meant to provide user-settable values this does not overwrite
existing cache entries by default.  Use the ``FORCE`` option to
overwrite existing entries.

The ``<type>`` must be specified as one of:

``BOOL``
  Boolean ``ON/OFF`` value.  ``cmake-gui(1)`` offers a checkbox.

``FILEPATH``
  Path to a file on disk.  ``cmake-gui(1)`` offers a file dialog.

``PATH``
  Path to a directory on disk.  ``cmake-gui(1)`` offers a file dialog.

``STRING``
  A line of text.  ``cmake-gui(1)`` offers a text field or a
  drop-down selection if the ``STRINGS`` cache entry
  property is set.

``INTERNAL``
  A line of text.  ``cmake-gui(1)`` does not show internal entries.
  They may be used to store variables persistently across runs.
  Use of this type implies ``FORCE``.

The ``<docstring>`` must be specified as a line of text providing
a quick summary of the option for presentation to ``cmake-gui(1)``
users.

If the cache entry does not exist prior to the call or the ``FORCE``
option is given then the cache entry will be set to the given value.
Furthermore, any normal variable binding in the current scope will
be removed to expose the newly cached value to any immediately
following evaluation.

It is possible for the cache entry to exist prior to the call but
have no type set if it was created on the ``cmake(1)`` command
line by a user through the ``-D<var>=<value>`` option without
specifying a type.  In this case the ``set`` command will add the
type.  Furthermore, if the ``<type>`` is ``PATH`` or ``FILEPATH``
and the ``<value>`` provided on the command line is a relative path,
then the ``set`` command will treat the path as relative to the
current working directory and convert it to an absolute path.

Set Environment Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 set(ENV{<variable>} [<value>])

Sets an ``Environment Variable``
to the given value.
Subsequent calls of ``$ENV{<variable>}`` will return this new value.

This command affects only the current CMake process, not the process
from which CMake was called, nor the system environment at large,
nor the environment of subsequent build or test processes.

If no argument is given after ``ENV{<variable>}`` or if ``<value>`` is
an empty string, then this command will clear any existing value of the
environment variable.

Arguments after ``<value>`` are ignored. If extra arguments are found,
then an author warning is issued.

set_directory_properties
------------------------

Set properties of the current directory and subdirectories.

 set_directory_properties(PROPERTIES prop1 value1 [prop2 value2] ...)

Sets properties of the current directory and its subdirectories in key-value pairs.

See also the ``set_property(DIRECTORY)`` command.

See :ref:`Directory Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake
and their individual documentation for the behavior of each property.

set_property
------------

Set a named property in a given scope.

 set_property(<GLOBAL                      |
               DIRECTORY [<dir>]           |
               TARGET    [<target1> ...]   |
               SOURCE    [<src1> ...]      |
               INSTALL   [<file1> ...]     |
               TEST      [<test1> ...]     |
               CACHE     [<entry1> ...]    >
              [APPEND] [APPEND_STRING]
              PROPERTY <name> [value1 ...])

Sets one property on zero or more objects of a scope.

The first argument determines the scope in which the property is set.
It must be one of the following:

``GLOBAL``
  Scope is unique and does not accept a name.

``DIRECTORY``
  Scope defaults to the current directory but another directory
  (already processed by CMake) may be named by full or relative path.
  See also the ``set_directory_properties()`` command.

``TARGET``
  Scope may name zero or more existing targets.
  See also the ``set_target_properties()`` command.

``SOURCE``
  Scope may name zero or more source files.  Note that source
  file properties are visible only to targets added in the same
  directory (``CMakeLists.txt``).
  See also the ``set_source_files_properties()`` command.

``INSTALL``
  Scope may name zero or more installed file paths.
  These are made available to CPack to influence deployment.

  Both the property key and value may use generator expressions.
  Specific properties may apply to installed files and/or directories.

  Path components have to be separated by forward slashes,
  must be normalized and are case sensitive.

  To reference the installation prefix itself with a relative path use ``.``.

  Currently installed file properties are only defined for
  the WIX generator where the given paths are relative
  to the installation prefix.

``TEST``
  Scope may name zero or more existing tests.
  See also the ``set_tests_properties()`` command.

``CACHE``
  Scope must name zero or more cache existing entries.

The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of
the property to set.  Remaining arguments are used to compose the
property value in the form of a semicolon-separated list.

If the ``APPEND`` option is given the list is appended to any existing
property value.  If the ``APPEND_STRING`` option is given the string is
appended to any existing property value as string, i.e. it results in a
longer string and not a list of strings.  When using ``APPEND`` or
``APPEND_STRING`` with a property defined to support ``INHERITED``
behavior (see ``define_property()``), no inheriting occurs when
finding the initial value to append to.  If the property is not already
directly set in the nominated scope, the command will behave as though
``APPEND`` or ``APPEND_STRING`` had not been given.

See the ``cmake-properties(7)`` manual for a list of properties
in each scope.

site_name
---------

Set the given variable to the name of the computer.

 site_name(variable)

Search and Replace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 string(FIND <string> <substring> <output_variable> [REVERSE])

Return the position where the given ``<substring>`` was found in
the supplied ``<string>``.  If the ``REVERSE`` flag was used, the command will
search for the position of the last occurrence of the specified
``<substring>``.  If the ``<substring>`` is not found, a position of -1 is
returned.

The ``string(FIND)`` subcommand treats all strings as ASCII-only characters.
The index stored in ``<output_variable>`` will also be counted in bytes,
so strings containing multi-byte characters may lead to unexpected results.

 string(REPLACE <match_string>
        <replace_string> <output_variable>
        <input> [<input>...])

Replace all occurrences of ``<match_string>`` in the ``<input>``
with ``<replace_string>`` and store the result in the ``<output_variable>``.

Regular Expressions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 string(REGEX MATCH <regular_expression>
        <output_variable> <input> [<input>...])

Match the ``<regular_expression>`` once and store the match in the
``<output_variable>``.
All ``<input>`` arguments are concatenated before matching.

 string(REGEX MATCHALL <regular_expression>
        <output_variable> <input> [<input>...])

Match the ``<regular_expression>`` as many times as possible and store the
matches in the ``<output_variable>`` as a list.
All ``<input>`` arguments are concatenated before matching.

 string(REGEX REPLACE <regular_expression>
        <replacement_expression> <output_variable>
        <input> [<input>...])

Match the ``<regular_expression>`` as many times as possible and substitute
the ``<replacement_expression>`` for the match in the output.
All ``<input>`` arguments are concatenated before matching.

The ``<replacement_expression>`` may refer to parenthesis-delimited
subexpressions of the match using ``\1``, ``\2``, ..., ``\9``.  Note that
two backslashes (``\\1``) are required in CMake code to get a backslash
through argument parsing.

Regex Specification
"""""""""""""""""""

The following characters have special meaning in regular expressions:

``^``
  Matches at beginning of input
``$``
  Matches at end of input
``.``
  Matches any single character
``\<char>``
  Matches the single character specified by ``<char>``.  Use this to
  match special regex characters, e.g. ``\.`` for a literal ``.``
  or ``\\`` for a literal backslash ``\``.  Escaping a non-special
  character is unnecessary but allowed, e.g. ``\a`` matches ``a``.
``[ ]``
  Matches any character(s) inside the brackets
``[^ ]``
  Matches any character(s) not inside the brackets
``-``
  Inside brackets, specifies an inclusive range between
  characters on either side e.g. ``[a-f]`` is ``[abcdef]``
  To match a literal ``-`` using brackets, make it the first
  or the last character e.g. ``[+*/-]`` matches basic
  mathematical operators.
``*``
  Matches preceding pattern zero or more times
``+``
  Matches preceding pattern one or more times
``?``
  Matches preceding pattern zero or once only
``|``
  Matches a pattern on either side of the ``|``
``()``
  Saves a matched subexpression, which can be referenced
  in the ``REGEX REPLACE`` operation. Additionally it is saved
  by all regular expression-related commands, including
  e.g. ``if(MATCHES)``, in the variables
  ``CMAKE_MATCH_<n>`` for ``<n>`` 0..9.

``*``, ``+`` and ``?`` have higher precedence than concatenation.  ``|``
has lower precedence than concatenation.  This means that the regular
expression ``^ab+d$`` matches ``abbd`` but not ``ababd``, and the regular
expression ``^(ab|cd)$`` matches ``ab`` but not ``abd``.

CMake language :ref:`Escape Sequences` such as ``\t``, ``\r``, ``\n``,
and ``\\`` may be used to construct literal tabs, carriage returns,
newlines, and backslashes (respectively) to pass in a regex.  For example:

* The quoted argument ``"[ \t\r\n]"`` specifies a regex that matches
  any single whitespace character.
* The quoted argument ``"[/\\]"`` specifies a regex that matches
  a single forward slash ``/`` or backslash ``\``.
* The quoted argument ``"[A-Za-z0-9_]"`` specifies a regex that matches
  any single "word" character in the C locale.
* The quoted argument ``"\\(\\a\\+b\\)"`` specifies a regex that matches
  the exact string ``(a+b)``.  Each ``\\`` is parsed in a quoted argument
  as just ``\``, so the regex itself is actually ``\(\a\+\b\)``.  This
  can alternatively be specified in a :ref:`bracket argument` without
  having to escape the backslashes, e.g. ``[[\(\a\+\b\)]]``.

Manipulation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 string(APPEND <string_variable> [<input>...])

Append all the ``<input>`` arguments to the string.

 string(PREPEND <string_variable> [<input>...])

Prepend all the ``<input>`` arguments to the string.

 string(CONCAT <output_variable> [<input>...])

Concatenate all the ``<input>`` arguments together and store
the result in the named ``<output_variable>``.

 string(JOIN <glue> <output_variable> [<input>...])

Join all the ``<input>`` arguments together using the ``<glue>``
string and store the result in the named ``<output_variable>``.

To join a list's elements, prefer to use the ``JOIN`` operator
from the ``list()`` command.  This allows for the elements to have
special characters like ``;`` in them.

 string(TOLOWER <string> <output_variable>)

Convert ``<string>`` to lower characters.

 string(TOUPPER <string> <output_variable>)

Convert ``<string>`` to upper characters.

 string(LENGTH <string> <output_variable>)

Store in an ``<output_variable>`` a given string's length in bytes.
Note that this means if ``<string>`` contains multi-byte characters, the
result stored in ``<output_variable>`` will *not* be the number of characters.

 string(SUBSTRING <string> <begin> <length> <output_variable>)

Store in an ``<output_variable>`` a substring of a given ``<string>``.  If
``<length>`` is ``-1`` the remainder of the string starting at ``<begin>``
will be returned.  If ``<string>`` is shorter than ``<length>`` then the
end of the string is used instead.

Both ``<begin>`` and ``<length>`` are counted in bytes, so care must
be exercised if ``<string>`` could contain multi-byte characters.

.. note::
  CMake 3.1 and below reported an error if ``<length>`` pointed past
  the end of ``<string>``.

 string(STRIP <string> <output_variable>)

Store in an ``<output_variable>`` a substring of a given ``<string>`` with
leading and trailing spaces removed.

 string(GENEX_STRIP <string> <output_variable>)

Strip any ``generator expressions``
from the input ``<string>`` and store the result in the ``<output_variable>``.

 string(REPEAT <string> <count> <output_variable>)

Produce the output string as the input ``<string>`` repeated ``<count>`` times.

Comparison
^^^^^^^^^^

 string(COMPARE LESS <string1> <string2> <output_variable>)
 string(COMPARE GREATER <string1> <string2> <output_variable>)
 string(COMPARE EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output_variable>)
 string(COMPARE NOTEQUAL <string1> <string2> <output_variable>)
 string(COMPARE LESS_EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output_variable>)
 string(COMPARE GREATER_EQUAL <string1> <string2> <output_variable>)

Compare the strings and store true or false in the ``<output_variable>``.

Hashing
^^^^^^^

 string(<HASH> <output_variable> <input>)

Compute a cryptographic hash of the ``<input>`` string.
The supported ``<HASH>`` algorithm names are:

``MD5``
  Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321.
``SHA1``
  US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174.
``SHA224``
  US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634.
``SHA256``
  US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634.
``SHA384``
  US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634.
``SHA512``
  US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634.
``SHA3_224``
  Keccak SHA-3.
``SHA3_256``
  Keccak SHA-3.
``SHA3_384``
  Keccak SHA-3.
``SHA3_512``
  Keccak SHA-3.

Generation
^^^^^^^^^^

 string(ASCII <number> [<number> ...] <output_variable>)

Convert all numbers into corresponding ASCII characters.

 string(CONFIGURE <string> <output_variable>
        [@ONLY] [ESCAPE_QUOTES])

Transform a ``<string>`` like ``configure_file()`` transforms a file.

 string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER <string> <output_variable>)

Convert each non-alphanumeric character in the input ``<string>`` to an
underscore and store the result in the ``<output_variable>``.  If the first
character of the ``<string>`` is a digit, an underscore will also be prepended
to the result.

 string(RANDOM [LENGTH <length>] [ALPHABET <alphabet>]
        [RANDOM_SEED <seed>] <output_variable>)

Return a random string of given ``<length>`` consisting of
characters from the given ``<alphabet>``.  Default length is 5 characters
and default alphabet is all numbers and upper and lower case letters.
If an integer ``RANDOM_SEED`` is given, its value will be used to seed the
random number generator.

 string(TIMESTAMP <output_variable> [<format_string>] [UTC])

Write a string representation of the current date
and/or time to the ``<output_variable>``.

If the command is unable to obtain a timestamp, the ``<output_variable>``
will be set to the empty string ``""``.

The optional ``UTC`` flag requests the current date/time representation to
be in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than local time.

The optional ``<format_string>`` may contain the following format
specifiers:

::

 %%        A literal percent sign (%).
 %d        The day of the current month (01-31).
 %H        The hour on a 24-hour clock (00-23).
 %I        The hour on a 12-hour clock (01-12).
 %j        The day of the current year (001-366).
 %m        The month of the current year (01-12).
 %b        Abbreviated month name (e.g. Oct).
 %B        Full month name (e.g. October).
 %M        The minute of the current hour (00-59).
 %s        Seconds since midnight (UTC) 1-Jan-1970 (UNIX time).
 %S        The second of the current minute.
           60 represents a leap second. (00-60)
 %U        The week number of the current year (00-53).
 %w        The day of the current week. 0 is Sunday. (0-6)
 %a        Abbreviated weekday name (e.g. Fri).
 %A        Full weekday name (e.g. Friday).
 %y        The last two digits of the current year (00-99)
 %Y        The current year.

Unknown format specifiers will be ignored and copied to the output
as-is.

If no explicit ``<format_string>`` is given, it will default to:

::

 %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S    for local time.
 %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ   for UTC.

.. note::

  If the ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` environment variable is set,
  its value will be used instead of the current time.
  See https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/ for details.

 string(UUID <output_variable> NAMESPACE <namespace> NAME <name>
        TYPE <MD5|SHA1> [UPPER])

Create a universally unique identifier (aka GUID) as per RFC4122
based on the hash of the combined values of ``<namespace>``
(which itself has to be a valid UUID) and ``<name>``.
The hash algorithm can be either ``MD5`` (Version 3 UUID) or
``SHA1`` (Version 5 UUID).
A UUID has the format ``xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx``
where each ``x`` represents a lower case hexadecimal character.
Where required, an uppercase representation can be requested
with the optional ``UPPER`` flag.

unset
-----

Unset a variable, cache variable, or environment variable.

Unset Normal Variable or Cache Entry
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 unset(<variable> [CACHE | PARENT_SCOPE])

Removes a normal variable from the current scope, causing it
to become undefined.  If ``CACHE`` is present, then a cache variable
is removed instead of a normal variable.  Note that when evaluating
:ref:`Variable References` of the form ``${VAR}``, CMake first searches
for a normal variable with that name.  If no such normal variable exists,
CMake will then search for a cache entry with that name.  Because of this
unsetting a normal variable can expose a cache variable that was previously
hidden.  To force a variable reference of the form ``${VAR}`` to return an
empty string, use ``set(<variable> "")``, which clears the normal variable
but leaves it defined.

If ``PARENT_SCOPE`` is present then the variable is removed from the scope
above the current scope.  See the same option in the ``set()`` command
for further details.

Unset Environment Variable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 unset(ENV{<variable>})

Removes ``<variable>`` from the currently available
``Environment Variables``.
Subsequent calls of ``$ENV{<variable>}`` will return the empty string.

This command affects only the current CMake process, not the process
from which CMake was called, nor the system environment at large,
nor the environment of subsequent build or test processes.

variable_watch
--------------

Watch the CMake variable for change.

 variable_watch(<variable> [<command>])

If the specified ``<variable>`` changes, a message will be printed
to inform about the change.

Additionally, if ``<command>`` is given, this command will be executed.
The command will receive the following arguments:
``COMMAND(<variable> <access> <value> <current_list_file> <stack>)``

while
-----

Evaluate a group of commands while a condition is true

 while(<condition>)
   <commands>
 endwhile()

All commands between while and the matching ``endwhile()`` are recorded
without being invoked.  Once the ``endwhile()`` is evaluated, the
recorded list of commands is invoked as long as the ``<condition>`` is true.

The ``<condition>`` has the same syntax and is evaluated using the same logic
as described at length for the ``if()`` command.

The commands ``break()`` and ``continue()`` provide means to
escape from the normal control flow.

Per legacy, the ``endwhile()`` command admits
an optional ``<condition>`` argument.
If used, it must be a verbatim repeat of the argument of the opening
``while`` command.

Project Commands
================

These commands are available only in CMake projects.

add_compile_definitions
-----------------------

Add preprocessor definitions to the compilation of source files.

 add_compile_definitions(<definition> ...)

Adds preprocessor definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the
current directory and below (whether added before or after this command is
invoked). See documentation of the ``directory``
and ``target`` ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` properties.

Definitions are specified using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported. CMake will automatically
escape the value correctly for the native build system (note that CMake
language syntax may require escapes to specify some values).

Arguments to ``add_compile_definitions`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

add_compile_options
-------------------

Add options to the compilation of source files.

 add_compile_options(<option> ...)

Adds options to the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` directory property.
These options are used when compiling targets from the current
directory and below.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

Arguments to ``add_compile_options`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The final set of compile or link options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.
While beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, ``-D A -D B`` becomes ``-D A B``.  One may
specify a group of options using shell-like quoting along with a ``SHELL:``
prefix.  The ``SHELL:`` prefix is dropped, and the rest of the option string
is parsed using the ``separate_arguments()`` ``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode.
For example, ``"SHELL:-D A" "SHELL:-D B"`` becomes ``-D A -D B``.

Example
^^^^^^^

Since different compilers support different options, a typical use of
this command is in a compiler-specific conditional clause:

 if (MSVC)
     # warning level 4 and all warnings as errors
     add_compile_options(/W4 /WX)
 else()
     # lots of warnings and all warnings as errors
     add_compile_options(-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror)
 endif()

See Also
^^^^^^^^

This command can be used to add any options. However, for
adding preprocessor definitions and include directories it is recommended
to use the more specific commands ``add_compile_definitions()``
and ``include_directories()``.

The command ``target_compile_options()`` adds target-specific options.

add_custom_command
------------------

Add a custom build rule to the generated build system.

There are two main signatures for ``add_custom_command``.

Generating Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first signature is for adding a custom command to produce an output:

 add_custom_command(OUTPUT output1 [output2 ...]
                    COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                    [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                    [MAIN_DEPENDENCY depend]
                    [DEPENDS [depends...]]
                    [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                    [IMPLICIT_DEPENDS <lang1> depend1
                                     [<lang2> depend2] ...]
                    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                    [COMMENT comment]
                    [DEPFILE depfile]
                    [JOB_POOL job_pool]
                    [VERBATIM] [APPEND] [USES_TERMINAL]
                    [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS])

This defines a command to generate specified ``OUTPUT`` file(s).
A target created in the same directory (``CMakeLists.txt`` file)
that specifies any output of the custom command as a source file
is given a rule to generate the file using the command at build time.
Do not list the output in more than one independent target that
may build in parallel or the two instances of the rule may conflict
(instead use the ``add_custom_target()`` command to drive the
command and make the other targets depend on that one).
In makefile terms this creates a new target in the following form::

 OUTPUT: MAIN_DEPENDENCY DEPENDS
         COMMAND

The options are:

``APPEND``
  Append the ``COMMAND`` and ``DEPENDS`` option values to the custom
  command for the first output specified.  There must have already
  been a previous call to this command with the same output.
  The ``COMMENT``, ``MAIN_DEPENDENCY``, and ``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  options are currently ignored when APPEND is given, but may be
  used in the future.

``BYPRODUCTS``
  Specify the files the command is expected to produce but whose
  modification time may or may not be newer than the dependencies.
  If a byproduct name is a relative path it will be interpreted
  relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.
  Each byproduct file will be marked with the ``GENERATED``
  source file property automatically.

  Explicit specification of byproducts is supported by the
  ``Ninja`` generator to tell the ``ninja`` build tool
  how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is
  also useful when other build rules (e.g. custom commands)
  depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule for any
  generated file on which another rule depends even if there are
  order-only dependencies to ensure the byproducts will be
  available before their dependents build.

``COMMAND``
  Specify the command-line(s) to execute at build time.
  If more than one ``COMMAND`` is specified they will be executed in order,
  but *not* necessarily composed into a stateful shell or batch script.
  (To run a full script, use the ``configure_file()`` command or the
  ``file(GENERATE)`` command to create it, and then specify
  a ``COMMAND`` to launch it.)
  The optional ``ARGS`` argument is for backward compatibility and
  will be ignored.

  If ``COMMAND`` specifies an executable target name (created by the
  ``add_executable()`` command), it will automatically be replaced
  by the location of the executable created at build time if either of
  the following is true:

  * The target is not being cross-compiled (i.e. the
    ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` variable is not set to true).
  * The target is being cross-compiled and an emulator is provided (i.e.
    its ``CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` target property is set).
    In this case, the contents of ``CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` will be
    prepended to the command before the location of the target executable.

  If neither of the above conditions are met, it is assumed that the
  command name is a program to be found on the ``PATH`` at build time.

  Arguments to ``COMMAND`` may use
  ``generator expressions``.
  Use the ``TARGET_FILE`` generator expression to refer to the location of
  a target later in the command line (i.e. as a command argument rather
  than as the command to execute).

  Whenever a target is used as a command to execute or is mentioned in a
  generator expression as a command argument, a target-level dependency
  will be added automatically so that the mentioned target will be built
  before any target using this custom command.  However this does NOT add
  a file-level dependency that would cause the custom command to re-run
  whenever the executable is recompiled.  List target names with
  the ``DEPENDS`` option to add such file-level dependencies.

``COMMENT``
  Display the given message before the commands are executed at
  build time.

``DEPENDS``
  Specify files on which the command depends.  If any dependency is
  an ``OUTPUT`` of another custom command in the same directory
  (``CMakeLists.txt`` file) CMake automatically brings the other
  custom command into the target in which this command is built.
  A target-level dependency is added if any dependency is listed as
  ``BYPRODUCTS`` of a target or any of its build events in the same
  directory to ensure the byproducts will be available.
  If ``DEPENDS`` is not specified the command will run whenever
  the ``OUTPUT`` is missing; if the command does not actually
  create the ``OUTPUT`` then the rule will always run.
  If ``DEPENDS`` specifies any target (created by the
  ``add_custom_target()``, ``add_executable()``, or
  ``add_library()`` command) a target-level dependency is
  created to make sure the target is built before any target
  using this custom command.  Additionally, if the target is an
  executable or library a file-level dependency is created to
  cause the custom command to re-run whenever the target is
  recompiled.

  Arguments to ``DEPENDS`` may use
  ``generator expressions``.

``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS``
  Lists in ``COMMAND`` arguments will be expanded, including those
  created with
  ``generator expressions``,
  allowing ``COMMAND`` arguments such as
  ``${CC} "-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>,;-I>" foo.cc``
  to be properly expanded.

``IMPLICIT_DEPENDS``
  Request scanning of implicit dependencies of an input file.
  The language given specifies the programming language whose
  corresponding dependency scanner should be used.
  Currently only ``C`` and ``CXX`` language scanners are supported.
  The language has to be specified for every file in the
  ``IMPLICIT_DEPENDS`` list.  Dependencies discovered from the
  scanning are added to those of the custom command at build time.
  Note that the ``IMPLICIT_DEPENDS`` option is currently supported
  only for Makefile generators and will be ignored by other generators.

``JOB_POOL``
  Specify a ``pool`` for the ``Ninja``
  generator. Incompatible with ``USES_TERMINAL``, which implies
  the ``console`` pool.
  Using a pool that is not defined by ``JOB_POOLS`` causes
  an error by ninja at build time.

``MAIN_DEPENDENCY``
  Specify the primary input source file to the command.  This is
  treated just like any value given to the ``DEPENDS`` option
  but also suggests to Visual Studio generators where to hang
  the custom command. Each source file may have at most one command
  specifying it as its main dependency. A compile command (i.e. for a
  library or an executable) counts as an implicit main dependency which
  gets silently overwritten by a custom command specification.

``OUTPUT``
  Specify the output files the command is expected to produce.
  If an output name is a relative path it will be interpreted
  relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.
  Each output file will be marked with the ``GENERATED``
  source file property automatically.
  If the output of the custom command is not actually created
  as a file on disk it should be marked with the ``SYMBOLIC``
  source file property.

``USES_TERMINAL``
  The command will be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
  With the ``Ninja`` generator, this places the command in
  the ``console`` ``pool``.

``VERBATIM``
  All arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the
  build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument
  unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the
  CMake language processor before add_custom_command even sees the
  arguments.  Use of ``VERBATIM`` is recommended as it enables
  correct behavior.  When ``VERBATIM`` is not given the behavior
  is platform specific because there is no protection of
  tool-specific special characters.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  Execute the command with the given current working directory.
  If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the
  build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.

  Arguments to ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` may use
  ``generator expressions``.

``DEPFILE``
  Specify a ``.d`` depfile for the ``Ninja`` generator.
  A ``.d`` file holds dependencies usually emitted by the custom
  command itself.
  Using ``DEPFILE`` with other generators than Ninja is an error.

Build Events
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The second signature adds a custom command to a target such as a
library or executable.  This is useful for performing an operation
before or after building the target.  The command becomes part of the
target and will only execute when the target itself is built.  If the
target is already built, the command will not execute.

 add_custom_command(TARGET <target>
                    PRE_BUILD | PRE_LINK | POST_BUILD
                    COMMAND command1 [ARGS] [args1...]
                    [COMMAND command2 [ARGS] [args2...] ...]
                    [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                    [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                    [COMMENT comment]
                    [VERBATIM] [USES_TERMINAL])

This defines a new command that will be associated with building the
specified ``<target>``.  The ``<target>`` must be defined in the current
directory; targets defined in other directories may not be specified.

When the command will happen is determined by which
of the following is specified:

``PRE_BUILD``
  On :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`, run before any other rules are
  executed within the target.
  On other generators, run just before ``PRE_LINK`` commands.
``PRE_LINK``
  Run after sources have been compiled but before linking the binary
  or running the librarian or archiver tool of a static library.
  This is not defined for targets created by the
  ``add_custom_target()`` command.
``POST_BUILD``
  Run after all other rules within the target have been executed.

.. note::
  Because generator expressions can be used in custom commands,
  it is possible to define ``COMMAND`` lines or whole custom commands
  which evaluate to empty strings for certain configurations.
  For **Visual Studio 2010 (and newer)** generators these command
  lines or custom commands will be omitted for the specific
  configuration and no "empty-string-command" will be added.

  This allows to add individual build events for every configuration.

add_custom_target
-----------------

Add a target with no output so it will always be built.

 add_custom_target(Name [ALL] [command1 [args1...]]
                   [COMMAND command2 [args2...] ...]
                   [DEPENDS depend depend depend ... ]
                   [BYPRODUCTS [files...]]
                   [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                   [COMMENT comment]
                   [JOB_POOL job_pool]
                   [VERBATIM] [USES_TERMINAL]
                   [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS]
                   [SOURCES src1 [src2...]])

Adds a target with the given name that executes the given commands.
The target has no output file and is *always considered out of date*
even if the commands try to create a file with the name of the target.
Use the ``add_custom_command()`` command to generate a file with
dependencies.  By default nothing depends on the custom target.  Use
the ``add_dependencies()`` command to add dependencies to or
from other targets.

The options are:

``ALL``
  Indicate that this target should be added to the default build
  target so that it will be run every time (the command cannot be
  called ``ALL``).

``BYPRODUCTS``
  Specify the files the command is expected to produce but whose
  modification time may or may not be updated on subsequent builds.
  If a byproduct name is a relative path it will be interpreted
  relative to the build tree directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.
  Each byproduct file will be marked with the ``GENERATED``
  source file property automatically.

  Explicit specification of byproducts is supported by the
  ``Ninja`` generator to tell the ``ninja`` build tool
  how to regenerate byproducts when they are missing.  It is
  also useful when other build rules (e.g. custom commands)
  depend on the byproducts.  Ninja requires a build rule for any
  generated file on which another rule depends even if there are
  order-only dependencies to ensure the byproducts will be
  available before their dependents build.

``COMMAND``
  Specify the command-line(s) to execute at build time.
  If more than one ``COMMAND`` is specified they will be executed in order,
  but *not* necessarily composed into a stateful shell or batch script.
  (To run a full script, use the ``configure_file()`` command or the
  ``file(GENERATE)`` command to create it, and then specify
  a ``COMMAND`` to launch it.)

  If ``COMMAND`` specifies an executable target name (created by the
  ``add_executable()`` command), it will automatically be replaced
  by the location of the executable created at build time if either of
  the following is true:

  * The target is not being cross-compiled (i.e. the
    ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` variable is not set to true).
  * The target is being cross-compiled and an emulator is provided (i.e.
    its ``CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` target property is set).
    In this case, the contents of ``CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` will be
    prepended to the command before the location of the target executable.

  If neither of the above conditions are met, it is assumed that the
  command name is a program to be found on the ``PATH`` at build time.

  Arguments to ``COMMAND`` may use
  ``generator expressions``.
  Use the ``TARGET_FILE`` generator expression to refer to the location of
  a target later in the command line (i.e. as a command argument rather
  than as the command to execute).

  Whenever a target is used as a command to execute or is mentioned in a
  generator expression as a command argument, a target-level dependency
  will be added automatically so that the mentioned target will be built
  before this custom target.

  The command and arguments are optional and if not specified an empty
  target will be created.

``COMMENT``
  Display the given message before the commands are executed at
  build time.

``DEPENDS``
  Reference files and outputs of custom commands created with
  ``add_custom_command()`` command calls in the same directory
  (``CMakeLists.txt`` file).  They will be brought up to date when
  the target is built.
  A target-level dependency is added if any dependency is a byproduct
  of a target or any of its build events in the same directory to ensure
  the byproducts will be available before this target is built.

  Use the ``add_dependencies()`` command to add dependencies
  on other targets.

``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS``
  Lists in ``COMMAND`` arguments will be expanded, including those
  created with
  ``generator expressions``,
  allowing ``COMMAND`` arguments such as
  ``${CC} "-I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>,;-I>" foo.cc``
  to be properly expanded.

``JOB_POOL``
  Specify a ``pool`` for the ``Ninja``
  generator. Incompatible with ``USES_TERMINAL``, which implies
  the ``console`` pool.
  Using a pool that is not defined by ``JOB_POOLS`` causes
  an error by ninja at build time.

``SOURCES``
  Specify additional source files to be included in the custom target.
  Specified source files will be added to IDE project files for
  convenience in editing even if they have no build rules.

``VERBATIM``
  All arguments to the commands will be escaped properly for the
  build tool so that the invoked command receives each argument
  unchanged.  Note that one level of escapes is still used by the
  CMake language processor before ``add_custom_target`` even sees
  the arguments.  Use of ``VERBATIM`` is recommended as it enables
  correct behavior.  When ``VERBATIM`` is not given the behavior
  is platform specific because there is no protection of
  tool-specific special characters.

``USES_TERMINAL``
  The command will be given direct access to the terminal if possible.
  With the ``Ninja`` generator, this places the command in
  the ``console`` ``pool``.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  Execute the command with the given current working directory.
  If it is a relative path it will be interpreted relative to the
  build tree directory corresponding to the current source directory.

  Arguments to ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` may use
  ``generator expressions``.

add_definitions
---------------

Add -D define flags to the compilation of source files.

 add_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

Adds definitions to the compiler command line for targets in the current
directory and below (whether added before or after this command is invoked).
This command can be used to add any flags, but it is intended to add
preprocessor definitions.

.. note::

  This command has been superseded by alternatives:

  * Use ``add_compile_definitions()`` to add preprocessor definitions.
  * Use ``include_directories()`` to add include directories.
  * Use ``add_compile_options()`` to add other options.

Flags beginning in ``-D`` or ``/D`` that look like preprocessor definitions are
automatically added to the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` directory
property for the current directory.  Definitions with non-trivial values
may be left in the set of flags instead of being converted for reasons of
backwards compatibility.  See documentation of the
``directory``,
``target``,
``source file`` ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
properties for details on adding preprocessor definitions to specific
scopes and configurations.

See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.

add_dependencies
----------------

Add a dependency between top-level targets.

 add_dependencies(<target> [<target-dependency>]...)

Makes a top-level ``<target>`` depend on other top-level targets to
ensure that they build before ``<target>`` does.  A top-level target
is one created by one of the ``add_executable()``,
``add_library()``, or ``add_custom_target()`` commands
(but not targets generated by CMake like ``install``).

Dependencies added to an :ref:`imported target <Imported Targets>`
or an :ref:`interface library <Interface Libraries>` are followed
transitively in its place since the target itself does not build.

See the ``DEPENDS`` option of ``add_custom_target()`` and
``add_custom_command()`` commands for adding file-level
dependencies in custom rules.  See the ``OBJECT_DEPENDS``
source file property to add file-level dependencies to object files.

add_executable
--------------

Add an executable to the project using the specified source files.

 add_executable(<name> [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE]
                [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
                [source1] [source2 ...])

Adds an executable target called ``<name>`` to be built from the source
files listed in the command invocation.  (The source files can be omitted
here if they are added later using ``target_sources()``.)  The
``<name>`` corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally
unique within a project.  The actual file name of the executable built is
constructed based on conventions of the native platform (such as
``<name>.exe`` or just ``<name>``).

By default the executable file will be created in the build tree
directory corresponding to the source tree directory in which the
command was invoked.  See documentation of the
``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` target property to change this
location.  See documentation of the ``OUTPUT_NAME`` target property
to change the ``<name>`` part of the final file name.

If ``WIN32`` is given the property ``WIN32_EXECUTABLE`` will be
set on the target created.  See documentation of that target property for
details.

If ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` is given the corresponding property will be set on
the created target.  See documentation of the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE``
target property for details.

If ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` is given the corresponding property will be set on
the created target.  See documentation of the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``
target property for details.

Source arguments to ``add_executable`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

See also ``HEADER_FILE_ONLY`` on what to do if some sources are
pre-processed, and you want to have the original sources reachable from
within IDE.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 add_executable(<name> IMPORTED [GLOBAL])

An :ref:`IMPORTED executable target <Imported Targets>` references an
executable file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to
build it, and the ``IMPORTED`` target property is ``True``.  The
target name has scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but
the ``GLOBAL`` option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any
target built within the project.  ``IMPORTED`` executables are useful
for convenient reference from commands like ``add_custom_command()``.
Details about the imported executable are specified by setting properties
whose names begin in ``IMPORTED_``.  The most important such property is
``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` (and its per-configuration version
``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>``) which specifies the location of
the main executable file on disk.  See documentation of the ``IMPORTED_*``
properties for more information.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

 add_executable(<name> ALIAS <target>)

Creates an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, such that ``<name>`` can
be used to refer to ``<target>`` in subsequent commands.  The ``<name>``
does not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The
``<target>`` may not be a non-``GLOBAL``
:ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` or an ``ALIAS``.
``ALIAS`` targets can be used as targets to read properties
from, executables for custom commands and custom targets.  They can also be
tested for existence with the regular ``if(TARGET)`` subcommand.
The ``<name>`` may not be used to modify properties of ``<target>``, that
is, it may not be used as the operand of ``set_property()``,
``set_target_properties()``, ``target_link_libraries()`` etc.
An ``ALIAS`` target may not be installed or exported.

add_library
-----------

Add a library to the project using the specified source files.

Normal Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 add_library(<name> [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
             [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
             [source1] [source2 ...])

Adds a library target called ``<name>`` to be built from the source files
listed in the command invocation.  (The source files can be omitted here
if they are added later using ``target_sources()``.)  The ``<name>``
corresponds to the logical target name and must be globally unique within
a project.  The actual file name of the library built is constructed based
on conventions of the native platform (such as ``lib<name>.a`` or
``<name>.lib``).

``STATIC``, ``SHARED``, or ``MODULE`` may be given to specify the type of
library to be created.  ``STATIC`` libraries are archives of object files
for use when linking other targets.  ``SHARED`` libraries are linked
dynamically and loaded at runtime.  ``MODULE`` libraries are plugins that
are not linked into other targets but may be loaded dynamically at runtime
using dlopen-like functionality.  If no type is given explicitly the
type is ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` based on whether the current value of the
variable ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` is ``ON``.  For ``SHARED`` and
``MODULE`` libraries the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target
property is set to ``ON`` automatically.
A ``SHARED`` or ``STATIC`` library may be marked with the ``FRAMEWORK``
target property to create an macOS Framework.

If a library does not export any symbols, it must not be declared as a
``SHARED`` library.  For example, a Windows resource DLL or a managed C++/CLI
DLL that exports no unmanaged symbols would need to be a ``MODULE`` library.
This is because CMake expects a ``SHARED`` library to always have an
associated import library on Windows.

By default the library file will be created in the build tree directory
corresponding to the source tree directory in which the command was
invoked.  See documentation of the ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``,
``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``, and
``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` target properties to change this
location.  See documentation of the ``OUTPUT_NAME`` target
property to change the ``<name>`` part of the final file name.

If ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` is given the corresponding property will be set on
the created target.  See documentation of the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``
target property for details.

Source arguments to ``add_library`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

See also ``HEADER_FILE_ONLY`` on what to do if some sources are
pre-processed, and you want to have the original sources reachable from
within IDE.

Imported Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 add_library(<name> <SHARED|STATIC|MODULE|OBJECT|UNKNOWN> IMPORTED
             [GLOBAL])

An :ref:`IMPORTED library target <Imported Targets>` references a library
file located outside the project.  No rules are generated to build it, and
the ``IMPORTED`` target property is ``True``.  The target name has
scope in the directory in which it is created and below, but the ``GLOBAL``
option extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any target built
within the project.  ``IMPORTED`` libraries are useful for convenient
reference from commands like ``target_link_libraries()``.  Details
about the imported library are specified by setting properties whose names
begin in ``IMPORTED_`` and ``INTERFACE_``.

The most important properties are:

* ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` (and its per-configuration
  variant ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>``) which specifies the
  location of the main library file on disk.
* ``IMPORTED_OBJECTS`` (and ``IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>``)
  for object libraries, specifies the locations of object files on disk.
* ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` files to be installed during ``install()`` invocation

See documentation of the ``IMPORTED_*`` and ``INTERFACE_*`` properties
for more information.

An ``UNKNOWN`` library type is typically only used in the implementation of
:ref:`Find Modules`.  It allows the path to an imported library (often found
using the ``find_library()`` command) to be used without having to know
what type of library it is.  This is especially useful on Windows where a
static library and a DLL's import library both have the same file extension.

Object Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 add_library(<name> OBJECT <src>...)

Creates an :ref:`Object Library <Object Libraries>`.  An object library
compiles source files but does not archive or link their object files into a
library.  Instead other targets created by ``add_library()`` or
``add_executable()`` may reference the objects using an expression of the
form ``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>`` as a source, where ``objlib`` is the
object library name.  For example:

 add_library(... $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib> ...)
 add_executable(... $<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib> ...)

will include objlib's object files in a library and an executable
along with those compiled from their own sources.  Object libraries
may contain only sources that compile, header files, and other files
that would not affect linking of a normal library (e.g. ``.txt``).
They may contain custom commands generating such sources, but not
``PRE_BUILD``, ``PRE_LINK``, or ``POST_BUILD`` commands.  Some native build
systems (such as Xcode) may not like targets that have only object files, so
consider adding at least one real source file to any target that references
``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objlib>``.

Alias Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 add_library(<name> ALIAS <target>)

Creates an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, such that ``<name>`` can be
used to refer to ``<target>`` in subsequent commands.  The ``<name>`` does
not appear in the generated buildsystem as a make target.  The ``<target>``
may not be a non-``GLOBAL`` :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` or an
``ALIAS``.
``ALIAS`` targets can be used as linkable targets and as targets to
read properties from.  They can also be tested for existence with the
regular ``if(TARGET)`` subcommand.  The ``<name>`` may not be used
to modify properties of ``<target>``, that is, it may not be used as the
operand of ``set_property()``, ``set_target_properties()``,
``target_link_libraries()`` etc.  An ``ALIAS`` target may not be
installed or exported.

Interface Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 add_library(<name> INTERFACE [IMPORTED [GLOBAL]])

Creates an :ref:`Interface Library <Interface Libraries>`.  An ``INTERFACE``
library target does not directly create build output, though it may
have properties set on it and it may be installed, exported and
imported. Typically the ``INTERFACE_*`` properties are populated on
the interface target using the commands:

* ``set_property()``,
* ``target_link_libraries(INTERFACE)``,
* ``target_link_options(INTERFACE)``,
* ``target_include_directories(INTERFACE)``,
* ``target_compile_options(INTERFACE)``,
* ``target_compile_definitions(INTERFACE)``, and
* ``target_sources(INTERFACE)``,

and then it is used as an argument to ``target_link_libraries()``
like any other target.

An ``INTERFACE`` :ref:`Imported Target <Imported Targets>` may also be
created with this signature.  An ``IMPORTED`` library target references a
library defined outside the project.  The target name has scope in the
directory in which it is created and below, but the ``GLOBAL`` option
extends visibility.  It may be referenced like any target built within
the project.  ``IMPORTED`` libraries are useful for convenient reference
from commands like ``target_link_libraries()``.

add_link_options
----------------

Add options to the link step for executable, shared library or module
library targets in the current directory and below that are added after
this command is invoked.

 add_link_options(<option> ...)

This command can be used to add any link options, but alternative commands
exist to add libraries (``target_link_libraries()`` or
``link_libraries()``).  See documentation of the
``directory`` and
``target`` ``LINK_OPTIONS`` properties.

.. note::

  This command cannot be used to add options for static library targets,
  since they do not use a linker.  To add archiver or MSVC librarian flags,
  see the ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS`` target property.

Arguments to ``add_link_options`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The final set of compile or link options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.
While beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, ``-D A -D B`` becomes ``-D A B``.  One may
specify a group of options using shell-like quoting along with a ``SHELL:``
prefix.  The ``SHELL:`` prefix is dropped, and the rest of the option string
is parsed using the ``separate_arguments()`` ``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode.
For example, ``"SHELL:-D A" "SHELL:-D B"`` becomes ``-D A -D B``.

To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The ``LINKER:`` prefix and ``,`` separator can be used to specify, in a portable
way, options to pass to the linker tool. ``LINKER:`` is replaced by the
appropriate driver option and ``,`` by the appropriate driver separator.
The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG`` and
``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP`` variables.

For example, ``"LINKER:-z,defs"`` becomes ``-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs`` for
``Clang`` and ``-Wl,-z,defs`` for ``GNU GCC``.

The ``LINKER:`` prefix can be specified as part of a ``SHELL:`` prefix
expression.

The ``LINKER:`` prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of
arguments using the ``SHELL:`` prefix and space as separator. The previous
example then becomes ``"LINKER:SHELL:-z defs"``.

.. note::

  Specifying the ``SHELL:`` prefix anywhere other than at the beginning of the
  ``LINKER:`` prefix is not supported.

add_subdirectory
----------------

Add a subdirectory to the build.

 add_subdirectory(source_dir [binary_dir] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

Adds a subdirectory to the build.  The source_dir specifies the
directory in which the source CMakeLists.txt and code files are
located.  If it is a relative path it will be evaluated with respect
to the current directory (the typical usage), but it may also be an
absolute path.  The ``binary_dir`` specifies the directory in which to
place the output files.  If it is a relative path it will be evaluated
with respect to the current output directory, but it may also be an
absolute path.  If ``binary_dir`` is not specified, the value of
``source_dir``, before expanding any relative path, will be used (the
typical usage).  The CMakeLists.txt file in the specified source
directory will be processed immediately by CMake before processing in
the current input file continues beyond this command.

If the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` argument is provided then targets in the
subdirectory will not be included in the ``ALL`` target of the parent
directory by default, and will be excluded from IDE project files.
Users must explicitly build targets in the subdirectory.  This is
meant for use when the subdirectory contains a separate part of the
project that is useful but not necessary, such as a set of examples.
Typically the subdirectory should contain its own ``project()``
command invocation so that a full build system will be generated in the
subdirectory (such as a VS IDE solution file).  Note that inter-target
dependencies supersede this exclusion.  If a target built by the
parent project depends on a target in the subdirectory, the dependee
target will be included in the parent project build system to satisfy
the dependency.

add_test
--------

Add a test to the project to be run by ``ctest(1)``.

 add_test(NAME <name> COMMAND <command> [<arg>...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS <config>...]
          [WORKING_DIRECTORY <dir>]
          [COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS])

Adds a test called ``<name>``.  The test name may not contain spaces,
quotes, or other characters special in CMake syntax.  The options are:

``COMMAND``
  Specify the test command-line.  If ``<command>`` specifies an
  executable target (created by ``add_executable()``) it will
  automatically be replaced by the location of the executable created
  at build time.

``CONFIGURATIONS``
  Restrict execution of the test only to the named configurations.

``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
  Set the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` test property to
  specify the working directory in which to execute the test.
  If not specified the test will be run with the current working
  directory set to the build directory corresponding to the
  current source directory.

``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS``
  Lists in ``COMMAND`` arguments will be expanded, including those
  created with
  ``generator expressions``.

The given test command is expected to exit with code ``0`` to pass and
non-zero to fail, or vice-versa if the ``WILL_FAIL`` test
property is set.  Any output written to stdout or stderr will be
captured by ``ctest(1)`` but does not affect the pass/fail status
unless the ``PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION``,
``FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` or
``SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` test property is used.

The ``COMMAND`` and ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` options may use "generator
expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.

Example usage:

 add_test(NAME mytest
          COMMAND testDriver --config $<CONFIGURATION>
                             --exe $<TARGET_FILE:myexe>)

This creates a test ``mytest`` whose command runs a ``testDriver`` tool
passing the configuration name and the full path to the executable
file produced by target ``myexe``.

.. note::

  CMake will generate tests only if the ``enable_testing()``
  command has been invoked.  The ``CTest`` module invokes the
  command automatically unless the ``BUILD_TESTING`` option is turned
  ``OFF``.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

 add_test(<name> <command> [<arg>...])

Add a test called ``<name>`` with the given command-line.  Unlike
the above ``NAME`` signature no transformation is performed on the
command-line to support target names or generator expressions.

aux_source_directory
--------------------

Find all source files in a directory.

 aux_source_directory(<dir> <variable>)

Collects the names of all the source files in the specified directory
and stores the list in the ``<variable>`` provided.  This command is
intended to be used by projects that use explicit template
instantiation.  Template instantiation files can be stored in a
``Templates`` subdirectory and collected automatically using this
command to avoid manually listing all instantiations.

It is tempting to use this command to avoid writing the list of source
files for a library or executable target.  While this seems to work,
there is no way for CMake to generate a build system that knows when a
new source file has been added.  Normally the generated build system
knows when it needs to rerun CMake because the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file is
modified to add a new source.  When the source is just added to the
directory without modifying this file, one would have to manually
rerun CMake to generate a build system incorporating the new file.

build_command
-------------

Get a command line to build the current project.
This is mainly intended for internal use by the ``CTest`` module.

 build_command(<variable>
               [CONFIGURATION <config>]
               [TARGET <target>]
               [PROJECT_NAME <projname>] # legacy, causes warning
              )

Sets the given ``<variable>`` to a command-line string of the form::

 <cmake> --build . [--config <config>] [--target <target>...] [-- -i]

where ``<cmake>`` is the location of the ``cmake(1)`` command-line
tool, and ``<config>`` and ``<target>`` are the values provided to the
``CONFIGURATION`` and ``TARGET`` options, if any.  The trailing ``-- -i``
option is added for :ref:`Makefile Generators` if policy ``CMP0061``
is not set to ``NEW``.

When invoked, this ``cmake --build`` command line will launch the
underlying build system tool.

 build_command(<cachevariable> <makecommand>)

This second signature is deprecated, but still available for backwards
compatibility.  Use the first signature instead.

It sets the given ``<cachevariable>`` to a command-line string as
above but without the ``--target`` option.
The ``<makecommand>`` is ignored but should be the full path to
devenv, nmake, make or one of the end user build tools
for legacy invocations.

.. note::
 In CMake versions prior to 3.0 this command returned a command
 line that directly invokes the native build tool for the current
 generator.  Their implementation of the ``PROJECT_NAME`` option
 had no useful effects, so CMake now warns on use of the option.

create_test_sourcelist
----------------------

Create a test driver and source list for building test programs.

 create_test_sourcelist(sourceListName driverName
                        test1 test2 test3
                        EXTRA_INCLUDE include.h
                        FUNCTION function)

A test driver is a program that links together many small tests into a
single executable.  This is useful when building static executables
with large libraries to shrink the total required size.  The list of
source files needed to build the test driver will be in
``sourceListName``.  ``driverName`` is the name of the test driver program.
The rest of the arguments consist of a list of test source files, can
be semicolon separated.  Each test source file should have a function
in it that is the same name as the file with no extension (foo.cxx
should have int foo(int, char*[]);) ``driverName`` will be able to call
each of the tests by name on the command line.  If ``EXTRA_INCLUDE`` is
specified, then the next argument is included into the generated file.
If ``FUNCTION`` is specified, then the next argument is taken as a
function name that is passed a pointer to ac and av.  This can be used
to add extra command line processing to each test.  The
``CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_BEFORE_TESTMAIN`` cmake variable can be set to
have code that will be placed directly before calling the test main function.
``CMAKE_TESTDRIVER_AFTER_TESTMAIN`` can be set to have code that
will be placed directly after the call to the test main function.

define_property
---------------

Define and document custom properties.

 define_property(<GLOBAL | DIRECTORY | TARGET | SOURCE |
                  TEST | VARIABLE | CACHED_VARIABLE>
                  PROPERTY <name> [INHERITED]
                  BRIEF_DOCS <brief-doc> [docs...]
                  FULL_DOCS <full-doc> [docs...])

Defines one property in a scope for use with the ``set_property()`` and
``get_property()`` commands.  This is primarily useful to associate
documentation with property names that may be retrieved with the
``get_property()`` command. The first argument determines the kind of
scope in which the property should be used.  It must be one of the
following:

::

 GLOBAL    = associated with the global namespace
 DIRECTORY = associated with one directory
 TARGET    = associated with one target
 SOURCE    = associated with one source file
 TEST      = associated with a test named with add_test
 VARIABLE  = documents a CMake language variable
 CACHED_VARIABLE = documents a CMake cache variable

Note that unlike ``set_property()`` and ``get_property()`` no
actual scope needs to be given; only the kind of scope is important.

The required ``PROPERTY`` option is immediately followed by the name of
the property being defined.

If the ``INHERITED`` option is given, then the ``get_property()`` command
will chain up to the next higher scope when the requested property is not set
in the scope given to the command.

* ``DIRECTORY`` scope chains to its parent directory's scope, continuing the
  walk up parent directories until a directory has the property set or there
  are no more parents.  If still not found at the top level directory, it
  chains to the ``GLOBAL`` scope.
* ``TARGET``, ``SOURCE`` and ``TEST`` properties chain to ``DIRECTORY`` scope,
  including further chaining up the directories, etc. as needed.

Note that this scope chaining behavior only applies to calls to
``get_property()``, ``get_directory_property()``,
``get_target_property()``, ``get_source_file_property()`` and
``get_test_property()``.  There is no inheriting behavior when *setting*
properties, so using ``APPEND`` or ``APPEND_STRING`` with the
``set_property()`` command will not consider inherited values when working
out the contents to append to.

The ``BRIEF_DOCS`` and ``FULL_DOCS`` options are followed by strings to be
associated with the property as its brief and full documentation.
Corresponding options to the ``get_property()`` command will retrieve
the documentation.

enable_language
---------------
Enable a language (CXX/C/OBJC/OBJCXX/Fortran/etc)

 enable_language(<lang> [OPTIONAL] )

Enables support for the named language in CMake.  This is
the same as the ``project()`` command but does not create any of the extra
variables that are created by the project command.  Example languages
are ``CXX``, ``C``, ``CUDA``, ``OBJC``, ``OBJCXX``, ``Fortran``, and ``ASM``.

If enabling ``ASM``, enable it last so that CMake can check whether
compilers for other languages like ``C`` work for assembly too.

This command must be called in file scope, not in a function call.
Furthermore, it must be called in the highest directory common to all
targets using the named language directly for compiling sources or
indirectly through link dependencies.  It is simplest to enable all
needed languages in the top-level directory of a project.

The ``OPTIONAL`` keyword is a placeholder for future implementation and
does not currently work. Instead you can use the ``CheckLanguage``
module to verify support before enabling.

enable_testing
--------------

Enable testing for current directory and below.

 enable_testing()

Enables testing for this directory and below.

This command should be in the source directory root
because ctest expects to find a test file in the build
directory root.

This command is automatically invoked when the ``CTest``
module is included, except if the ``BUILD_TESTING`` option is
turned off.

See also the ``add_test()`` command.

export
------

Export targets from the build tree for use by outside projects.

 export(EXPORT <export-name> [NAMESPACE <namespace>] [FILE <filename>])

Creates a file ``<filename>`` that may be included by outside projects to
import targets from the current project's build tree.  This is useful
during cross-compiling to build utility executables that can run on
the host platform in one project and then import them into another
project being compiled for the target platform.  If the ``NAMESPACE``
option is given the ``<namespace>`` string will be prepended to all target
names written to the file.

Target installations are associated with the export ``<export-name>``
using the ``EXPORT`` option of the ``install(TARGETS)`` command.

The file created by this command is specific to the build tree and
should never be installed.  See the ``install(EXPORT)`` command to
export targets from an installation tree.

The properties set on the generated IMPORTED targets will have the
same values as the final values of the input TARGETS.

 export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]] [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
        [APPEND] FILE <filename> [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES])

This signature is similar to the ``EXPORT`` signature, but targets are listed
explicitly rather than specified as an export-name.  If the APPEND option is
given the generated code will be appended to the file instead of overwriting it.
The EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES keyword, if present, causes the
contents of the properties matching
``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` to be exported, when
policy CMP0022 is NEW.  If a library target is included in the export
but a target to which it links is not included the behavior is
unspecified.

.. note::

  :ref:`Object Libraries` under ``Xcode`` have special handling if
  multiple architectures are listed in ``CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES``.
  In this case they will be exported as :ref:`Interface Libraries` with
  no object files available to clients.  This is sufficient to satisfy
  transitive usage requirements of other targets that link to the
  object libraries in their implementation.

 export(PACKAGE <PackageName>)

Store the current build directory in the CMake user package registry
for package ``<PackageName>``.  The ``find_package()`` command may consider the
directory while searching for package ``<PackageName>``.  This helps dependent
projects find and use a package from the current project's build tree
without help from the user.  Note that the entry in the package
registry that this command creates works only in conjunction with a
package configuration file (``<PackageName>Config.cmake``) that works with the
build tree. In some cases, for example for packaging and for system
wide installations, it is not desirable to write the user package
registry.

By default the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command does nothing (see policy
``CMP0090``) because populating the user package registry has effects
outside the source and build trees.  Set the
``CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable to add build directories to
the CMake user package registry.

 export(TARGETS [target1 [target2 [...]]]  [ANDROID_MK <filename>])

This signature exports cmake built targets to the android ndk build system
by creating an Android.mk file that references the prebuilt targets. The
Android NDK supports the use of prebuilt libraries, both static and shared.
This allows cmake to build the libraries of a project and make them available
to an ndk build system complete with transitive dependencies, include flags
and defines required to use the libraries. The signature takes a list of
targets and puts them in the Android.mk file specified by the ``<filename>``
given. This signature can only be used if policy CMP0022 is NEW for all
targets given. A error will be issued if that policy is set to OLD for one
of the targets.

fltk_wrap_ui
------------

Create FLTK user interfaces Wrappers.

 fltk_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName source1
              source2 ... sourceN )

Produce .h and .cxx files for all the .fl and .fld files listed.  The
resulting .h and .cxx files will be added to a variable named
``resultingLibraryName_FLTK_UI_SRCS`` which should be added to your
library.

get_source_file_property
------------------------

Get a property for a source file.

 get_source_file_property(VAR file property)

Gets a property from a source file.  The value of the property is
stored in the variable ``VAR``.  If the source property is not found, the
behavior depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property
or not (see ``define_property()``).  Non-inherited properties will set
``VAR`` to "NOTFOUND", whereas inherited properties will search the relevant
parent scope as described for the ``define_property()`` command and
if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to an empty string.

Use ``set_source_files_properties()`` to set property values.  Source
file properties usually control how the file is built. One property that is
always there is ``LOCATION``.

See also the more general ``get_property()`` command.

get_target_property
-------------------

Get a property from a target.

 get_target_property(VAR target property)

Get a property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in
the variable ``VAR``.  If the target property is not found, the behavior
depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property
or not (see ``define_property()``).  Non-inherited properties will
set ``VAR`` to ``NOTFOUND``, whereas inherited properties will search the
relevant parent scope as described for the ``define_property()``
command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to
an empty string.

Use ``set_target_properties()`` to set target property values.
Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some
query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any
target so far created.  The targets do not need to be in the current
``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

See also the more general ``get_property()`` command.

See :ref:`Target Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake.

get_test_property
-----------------

Get a property of the test.

 get_test_property(test property VAR)

Get a property from the test.  The value of the property is stored in
the variable ``VAR``.  If the test property is not found, the behavior
depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property
or not (see ``define_property()``).  Non-inherited properties will
set ``VAR`` to "NOTFOUND", whereas inherited properties will search the
relevant parent scope as described for the ``define_property()``
command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to
an empty string.

For a list of standard properties you can type ``cmake --help-property-list``.

See also the more general ``get_property()`` command.

include_directories
-------------------

Add include directories to the build.

 include_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] [SYSTEM] dir1 [dir2 ...])

Add the given directories to those the compiler uses to search for
include files.  Relative paths are interpreted as relative to the
current source directory.

The include directories are added to the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
directory property for the current ``CMakeLists`` file.  They are also
added to the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property for each
target in the current ``CMakeLists`` file.  The target property values
are the ones used by the generators.

By default the directories specified are appended onto the current list of
directories.  This default behavior can be changed by setting
``CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE`` to ``ON``.  By using
``AFTER`` or ``BEFORE`` explicitly, you can select between appending and
prepending, independent of the default.

If the ``SYSTEM`` option is given, the compiler will be told the
directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms.
Signalling this setting might achieve effects such as the compiler
skipping warnings, or these fixed-install system files not being
considered in dependency calculations - see compiler docs.

Arguments to ``include_directories`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax "$<...>".  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::

  Prefer the ``target_include_directories()`` command to add include
  directories to individual targets and optionally propagate/export them
  to dependents.

include_external_msproject
--------------------------

Include an external Microsoft project file in a workspace.

 include_external_msproject(projectname location
                            [TYPE projectTypeGUID]
                            [GUID projectGUID]
                            [PLATFORM platformName]
                            dep1 dep2 ...)

Includes an external Microsoft project in the generated workspace
file.  Currently does nothing on UNIX.  This will create a target
named ``[projectname]``.  This can be used in the ``add_dependencies()``
command to make things depend on the external project.

``TYPE``, ``GUID`` and ``PLATFORM`` are optional parameters that allow one to
specify the type of project, id (``GUID``) of the project and the name of
the target platform.  This is useful for projects requiring values
other than the default (e.g.  WIX projects).

If the imported project has different configuration names than the
current project, set the ``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>``
target property to specify the mapping.

include_regular_expression
--------------------------

Set the regular expression used for dependency checking.

 include_regular_expression(regex_match [regex_complain])

Sets the regular expressions used in dependency checking.  Only files
matching ``regex_match`` will be traced as dependencies.  Only files
matching ``regex_complain`` will generate warnings if they cannot be found
(standard header paths are not searched).  The defaults are:

::

 regex_match    = "^.*$" (match everything)
 regex_complain = "^$" (match empty string only)

install
-------

Specify rules to run at install time.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

 install(TARGETS <target>... [...])
 install({FILES | PROGRAMS} <file>... [...])
 install(DIRECTORY <dir>... [...])
 install(SCRIPT <file> [...])
 install(CODE <code> [...])
 install(EXPORT <export-name> [...])

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This command generates installation rules for a project.  Rules
specified by calls to this command within a source directory are
executed in order during installation.  The order across directories
is not defined.

There are multiple signatures for this command.  Some of them define
installation options for files and targets.  Options common to
multiple signatures are covered here but they are valid only for
signatures that specify them.  The common options are:

``DESTINATION``
  Specify the directory on disk to which a file will be installed.
  If a full path (with a leading slash or drive letter) is given
  it is used directly.  If a relative path is given it is interpreted
  relative to the value of the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.
  The prefix can be relocated at install time using the ``DESTDIR``
  mechanism explained in the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable
  documentation.

``PERMISSIONS``
  Specify permissions for installed files.  Valid permissions are
  ``OWNER_READ``, ``OWNER_WRITE``, ``OWNER_EXECUTE``, ``GROUP_READ``,
  ``GROUP_WRITE``, ``GROUP_EXECUTE``, ``WORLD_READ``, ``WORLD_WRITE``,
  ``WORLD_EXECUTE``, ``SETUID``, and ``SETGID``.  Permissions that do
  not make sense on certain platforms are ignored on those platforms.

``CONFIGURATIONS``
  Specify a list of build configurations for which the install rule
  applies (Debug, Release, etc.). Note that the values specified for
  this option only apply to options listed AFTER the ``CONFIGURATIONS``
  option. For example, to set separate install paths for the Debug and
  Release configurations, do the following:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    install(TARGETS target
            CONFIGURATIONS Debug
            RUNTIME DESTINATION Debug/bin)
    install(TARGETS target
            CONFIGURATIONS Release
            RUNTIME DESTINATION Release/bin)

  Note that ``CONFIGURATIONS`` appears BEFORE ``RUNTIME DESTINATION``.

``COMPONENT``
  Specify an installation component name with which the install rule
  is associated, such as "runtime" or "development".  During
  component-specific installation only install rules associated with
  the given component name will be executed.  During a full installation
  all components are installed unless marked with ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``.
  If ``COMPONENT`` is not provided a default component "Unspecified" is
  created.  The default component name may be controlled with the
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME`` variable.

``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``
  Specify that the file is excluded from a full installation and only
  installed as part of a component-specific installation

``RENAME``
  Specify a name for an installed file that may be different from the
  original file.  Renaming is allowed only when a single file is
  installed by the command.

``OPTIONAL``
  Specify that it is not an error if the file to be installed does
  not exist.

Command signatures that install files may print messages during
installation.  Use the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE`` variable
to control which messages are printed.

Many of the ``install()`` variants implicitly create the directories
containing the installed files. If
``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`` is set, these
directories will be created with the permissions specified. Otherwise,
they will be created according to the uname rules on Unix-like platforms.
Windows platforms are unaffected.

Installing Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 install(TARGETS targets... [EXPORT <export-name>]
         [[ARCHIVE|LIBRARY|RUNTIME|OBJECTS|FRAMEWORK|BUNDLE|
           PRIVATE_HEADER|PUBLIC_HEADER|RESOURCE]
          [DESTINATION <dir>]
          [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
          [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
          [COMPONENT <component>]
          [NAMELINK_COMPONENT <component>]
          [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
          [NAMELINK_ONLY|NAMELINK_SKIP]
         ] [...]
         [INCLUDES DESTINATION [<dir> ...]]
         )

The ``TARGETS`` form specifies rules for installing targets from a
project.  There are several kinds of target files that may be installed:

``ARCHIVE``
  Static libraries are treated as ``ARCHIVE`` targets, except those
  marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property on macOS (see ``FRAMEWORK``
  below.) For DLL platforms (all Windows-based systems including
  Cygwin), the DLL import library is treated as an ``ARCHIVE`` target.
  On AIX, the linker import file created for executables with
  ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` is treated as an ``ARCHIVE`` target.

``LIBRARY``
  Module libraries are always treated as ``LIBRARY`` targets. For non-
  DLL platforms shared libraries are treated as ``LIBRARY`` targets,
  except those marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property on macOS (see
  ``FRAMEWORK`` below.)

``RUNTIME``
  Executables are treated as ``RUNTIME`` objects, except those marked
  with the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property on macOS (see ``BUNDLE`` below.)
  For DLL platforms (all Windows-based systems including Cygwin), the
  DLL part of a shared library is treated as a ``RUNTIME`` target.

``OBJECTS``
  Object libraries (a simple group of object files) are always treated
  as ``OBJECTS`` targets.

``FRAMEWORK``
  Both static and shared libraries marked with the ``FRAMEWORK``
  property are treated as ``FRAMEWORK`` targets on macOS.

``BUNDLE``
  Executables marked with the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property are treated as
  ``BUNDLE`` targets on macOS.

``PUBLIC_HEADER``
  Any ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` files associated with a library are installed in
  the destination specified by the ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` argument on non-Apple
  platforms. Rules defined by this argument are ignored for ``FRAMEWORK``
  libraries on Apple platforms because the associated files are installed
  into the appropriate locations inside the framework folder. See
  ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` for details.

``PRIVATE_HEADER``
  Similar to ``PUBLIC_HEADER``, but for ``PRIVATE_HEADER`` files. See
  ``PRIVATE_HEADER`` for details.

``RESOURCE``
  Similar to ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` and ``PRIVATE_HEADER``, but for
  ``RESOURCE`` files. See ``RESOURCE`` for details.

For each of these arguments given, the arguments following them only apply
to the target or file type specified in the argument. If none is given, the
installation properties apply to all target types. If only one is given then
only targets of that type will be installed (which can be used to install
just a DLL or just an import library.)

For regular executables, static libraries and shared libraries, the
``DESTINATION`` argument is not required.  For these target types, when
``DESTINATION`` is omitted, a default destination will be taken from the
appropriate variable from ``GNUInstallDirs``, or set to a built-in
default value if that variable is not defined.  The same is true for the
public and private headers associated with the installed targets through the
``PUBLIC_HEADER`` and ``PRIVATE_HEADER`` target properties.
A destination must always be provided for module libraries, Apple bundles and
frameworks.  A destination can be omitted for interface and object libraries,
but they are handled differently (see the discussion of this topic toward the
end of this section).

The following table shows the target types with their associated variables and
built-in defaults that apply when no destination is given:

================== =============================== ======================
   Target Type         GNUInstallDirs Variable        Built-In Default
================== =============================== ======================
``RUNTIME``        ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}``     ``bin``
``LIBRARY``        ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}``     ``lib``
``ARCHIVE``        ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}``     ``lib``
``PRIVATE_HEADER`` ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}`` ``include``
``PUBLIC_HEADER``  ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}`` ``include``
================== =============================== ======================

Projects wishing to follow the common practice of installing headers into a
project-specific subdirectory will need to provide a destination rather than
rely on the above.

To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if
projects must specify a ``DESTINATION``, it is recommended that they use a
path that begins with the appropriate ``GNUInstallDirs`` variable.
This allows package maintainers to control the install destination by setting
the appropriate cache variables.  The following example shows a static library
being installed to the default destination provided by
``GNUInstallDirs``, but with its headers installed to a project-specific
subdirectory that follows the above recommendation:

 add_library(mylib STATIC ...)
 set_target_properties(mylib PROPERTIES PUBLIC_HEADER mylib.h)
 include(GNUInstallDirs)
 install(TARGETS mylib
         PUBLIC_HEADER
           DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/myproj
 )

In addition to the common options listed above, each target can accept
the following additional arguments:

``NAMELINK_COMPONENT``
  On some platforms a versioned shared library has a symbolic link such
  as::

   lib<name>.so -> lib<name>.so.1

 where ``lib<name>.so.1`` is the soname of the library and ``lib<name>.so``
 is a "namelink" allowing linkers to find the library when given
 ``-l<name>``. The ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT`` option is similar to the
 ``COMPONENT`` option, but it changes the installation component of a shared
 library namelink if one is generated. If not specified, this defaults to the
 value of ``COMPONENT``. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
 ``LIBRARY`` block.

 Consider the following example:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   install(TARGETS mylib
           LIBRARY
             COMPONENT Libraries
             NAMELINK_COMPONENT Development
           PUBLIC_HEADER
             COMPONENT Development
          )

 In this scenario, if you choose to install only the ``Development``
 component, both the headers and namelink will be installed without the
 library. (If you don't also install the ``Libraries`` component, the
 namelink will be a dangling symlink, and projects that link to the library
 will have build errors.) If you install only the ``Libraries`` component,
 only the library will be installed, without the headers and namelink.

 This option is typically used for package managers that have separate
 runtime and development packages. For example, on Debian systems, the
 library is expected to be in the runtime package, and the headers and
 namelink are expected to be in the development package.

 See the :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` target properties for
 details on creating versioned shared libraries.

``NAMELINK_ONLY``
  This option causes the installation of only the namelink when a library
  target is installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries do not
  have namelinks or when a library is not versioned, the ``NAMELINK_ONLY``
  option installs nothing. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
  ``LIBRARY`` block.

  When ``NAMELINK_ONLY`` is given, either ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT`` or
  ``COMPONENT`` may be used to specify the installation component of the
  namelink, but ``COMPONENT`` should generally be preferred.

``NAMELINK_SKIP``
  Similar to ``NAMELINK_ONLY``, but it has the opposite effect: it causes the
  installation of library files other than the namelink when a library target
  is installed. When neither ``NAMELINK_ONLY`` or ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` are given,
  both portions are installed. On platforms where versioned shared libraries
  do not have symlinks or when a library is not versioned, ``NAMELINK_SKIP``
  installs the library. It is an error to use this parameter outside of a
  ``LIBRARY`` block.

  If ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` is specified, ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT`` has no effect. It
  is not recommended to use ``NAMELINK_SKIP`` in conjunction with
  ``NAMELINK_COMPONENT``.

The install(TARGETS) command can also accept the following options at the
top level:

``EXPORT``
  This option associates the installed target files with an export called
  ``<export-name>``.  It must appear before any target options.  To actually
  install the export file itself, call install(EXPORT), documented below.
  See documentation of the ``EXPORT_NAME`` target property to change
  the name of the exported target.

``INCLUDES DESTINATION``
  This option specifies a list of directories which will be added to the
  ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property of the
  ``<targets>`` when exported by the install(EXPORT) command. If a
  relative path is specified, it is treated as relative to the
  ``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``.

One or more groups of properties may be specified in a single call to
the ``TARGETS`` form of this command.  A target may be installed more than
once to different locations.  Consider hypothetical targets ``myExe``,
``mySharedLib``, and ``myStaticLib``.  The code:

 install(TARGETS myExe mySharedLib myStaticLib
         RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
         LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
         ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib/static)
 install(TARGETS mySharedLib DESTINATION /some/full/path)

will install ``myExe`` to ``<prefix>/bin`` and ``myStaticLib`` to
``<prefix>/lib/static``.  On non-DLL platforms ``mySharedLib`` will be
installed to ``<prefix>/lib`` and ``/some/full/path``.  On DLL platforms
the ``mySharedLib`` DLL will be installed to ``<prefix>/bin`` and
``/some/full/path`` and its import library will be installed to
``<prefix>/lib/static`` and ``/some/full/path``.

:ref:`Interface Libraries` may be listed among the targets to install.
They install no artifacts but will be included in an associated ``EXPORT``.
If :ref:`Object Libraries` are listed but given no destination for their
object files, they will be exported as :ref:`Interface Libraries`.
This is sufficient to satisfy transitive usage requirements of other
targets that link to the object libraries in their implementation.

Installing a target with the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` target property
set to ``TRUE`` has undefined behavior.

install(TARGETS) can install targets that were created in
other directories.  When using such cross-directory install rules, running
``make install`` (or similar) from a subdirectory will not guarantee that
targets from other directories are up-to-date.  You can use
``target_link_libraries()`` or ``add_dependencies()``
to ensure that such out-of-directory targets are built before the
subdirectory-specific install rules are run.

An install destination given as a ``DESTINATION`` argument may
use "generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.

Installing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 install(<FILES|PROGRAMS> files...
         TYPE <type> | DESTINATION <dir>
         [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
         [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
         [COMPONENT <component>]
         [RENAME <name>] [OPTIONAL] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])

The ``FILES`` form specifies rules for installing files for a project.
File names given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
current source directory.  Files installed by this form are by default
given permissions ``OWNER_WRITE``, ``OWNER_READ``, ``GROUP_READ``, and
``WORLD_READ`` if no ``PERMISSIONS`` argument is given.

The ``PROGRAMS`` form is identical to the ``FILES`` form except that the
default permissions for the installed file also include ``OWNER_EXECUTE``,
``GROUP_EXECUTE``, and ``WORLD_EXECUTE``.  This form is intended to install
programs that are not targets, such as shell scripts.  Use the ``TARGETS``
form to install targets built within the project.

The list of ``files...`` given to ``FILES`` or ``PROGRAMS`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.
However, if any item begins in a generator expression it must evaluate
to a full path.

Either a ``TYPE`` or a ``DESTINATION`` must be provided, but not both.
A ``TYPE`` argument specifies the generic file type of the files being
installed.  A destination will then be set automatically by taking the
corresponding variable from ``GNUInstallDirs``, or by using a
built-in default if that variable is not defined.  See the table below for
the supported file types and their corresponding variables and built-in
defaults.  Projects can provide a ``DESTINATION`` argument instead of a
file type if they wish to explicitly define the install destination.

======================= ================================== =========================
   ``TYPE`` Argument         GNUInstallDirs Variable           Built-In Default
======================= ================================== =========================
``BIN``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}``        ``bin``
``SBIN``                ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_SBINDIR}``       ``sbin``
``LIB``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}``        ``lib``
``INCLUDE``             ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}``    ``include``
``SYSCONF``             ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR}``    ``etc``
``SHAREDSTATE``         ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_SHARESTATEDIR}`` ``com``
``LOCALSTATE``          ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LOCALSTATEDIR}`` ``var``
``RUNSTATE``            ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_RUNSTATEDIR}``   ``<LOCALSTATE dir>/run``
``DATA``                ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}``       ``<DATAROOT dir>``
``INFO``                ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_INFODIR}``       ``<DATAROOT dir>/info``
``LOCALE``              ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LOCALEDIR}``     ``<DATAROOT dir>/locale``
``MAN``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_MANDIR}``        ``<DATAROOT dir>/man``
``DOC``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR}``        ``<DATAROOT dir>/doc``
======================= ================================== =========================

Projects wishing to follow the common practice of installing headers into a
project-specific subdirectory will need to provide a destination rather than
rely on the above.

Note that some of the types' built-in defaults use the ``DATAROOT`` directory as
a prefix. The ``DATAROOT`` prefix is calculated similarly to the types, with
``CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR`` as the variable and ``share`` as the built-in
default. You cannot use ``DATAROOT`` as a ``TYPE`` parameter; please use
``DATA`` instead.

To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if
projects must specify a ``DESTINATION``, it is recommended that they use a
path that begins with the appropriate ``GNUInstallDirs`` variable.
This allows package maintainers to control the install destination by setting
the appropriate cache variables.  The following example shows how to follow
this advice while installing headers to a project-specific subdirectory:

 include(GNUInstallDirs)
 install(FILES mylib.h
         DESTINATION ${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}/myproj
 )

An install destination given as a ``DESTINATION`` argument may
use "generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.

Installing Directories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 install(DIRECTORY dirs...
         TYPE <type> | DESTINATION <dir>
         [FILE_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
         [DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS permissions...]
         [USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS] [OPTIONAL] [MESSAGE_NEVER]
         [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
         [COMPONENT <component>] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
         [FILES_MATCHING]
         [[PATTERN <pattern> | REGEX <regex>]
          [EXCLUDE] [PERMISSIONS permissions...]] [...])

The ``DIRECTORY`` form installs contents of one or more directories to a
given destination.  The directory structure is copied verbatim to the
destination.  The last component of each directory name is appended to
the destination directory but a trailing slash may be used to avoid
this because it leaves the last component empty.  Directory names
given as relative paths are interpreted with respect to the current
source directory.  If no input directory names are given the
destination directory will be created but nothing will be installed
into it.  The ``FILE_PERMISSIONS`` and ``DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`` options
specify permissions given to files and directories in the destination.
If ``USE_SOURCE_PERMISSIONS`` is specified and ``FILE_PERMISSIONS`` is not,
file permissions will be copied from the source directory structure.
If no permissions are specified files will be given the default
permissions specified in the ``FILES`` form of the command, and the
directories will be given the default permissions specified in the
``PROGRAMS`` form of the command.

The ``MESSAGE_NEVER`` option disables file installation status output.

Installation of directories may be controlled with fine granularity
using the ``PATTERN`` or ``REGEX`` options.  These "match" options specify a
globbing pattern or regular expression to match directories or files
encountered within input directories.  They may be used to apply
certain options (see below) to a subset of the files and directories
encountered.  The full path to each input file or directory (with
forward slashes) is matched against the expression.  A ``PATTERN`` will
match only complete file names: the portion of the full path matching
the pattern must occur at the end of the file name and be preceded by
a slash.  A ``REGEX`` will match any portion of the full path but it may
use ``/`` and ``$`` to simulate the ``PATTERN`` behavior.  By default all
files and directories are installed whether or not they are matched.
The ``FILES_MATCHING`` option may be given before the first match option
to disable installation of files (but not directories) not matched by
any expression.  For example, the code

 install(DIRECTORY src/ DESTINATION include/myproj
         FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")

will extract and install header files from a source tree.

Some options may follow a ``PATTERN`` or ``REGEX`` expression and are applied
only to files or directories matching them.  The ``EXCLUDE`` option will
skip the matched file or directory.  The ``PERMISSIONS`` option overrides
the permissions setting for the matched file or directory.  For
example the code

 install(DIRECTORY icons scripts/ DESTINATION share/myproj
         PATTERN "CVS" EXCLUDE
         PATTERN "scripts/*"
         PERMISSIONS OWNER_EXECUTE OWNER_WRITE OWNER_READ
                     GROUP_EXECUTE GROUP_READ)

will install the ``icons`` directory to ``share/myproj/icons`` and the
``scripts`` directory to ``share/myproj``.  The icons will get default
file permissions, the scripts will be given specific permissions, and any
``CVS`` directories will be excluded.

Either a ``TYPE`` or a ``DESTINATION`` must be provided, but not both.
A ``TYPE`` argument specifies the generic file type of the files within the
listed directories being installed.  A destination will then be set
automatically by taking the corresponding variable from
``GNUInstallDirs``, or by using a built-in default if that variable
is not defined.  See the table below for the supported file types and their
corresponding variables and built-in defaults.  Projects can provide a
``DESTINATION`` argument instead of a file type if they wish to explicitly
define the install destination.

======================= ================================== =========================
   ``TYPE`` Argument         GNUInstallDirs Variable           Built-In Default
======================= ================================== =========================
``BIN``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_BINDIR}``        ``bin``
``SBIN``                ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_SBINDIR}``       ``sbin``
``LIB``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR}``        ``lib``
``INCLUDE``             ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_INCLUDEDIR}``    ``include``
``SYSCONF``             ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSCONFDIR}``    ``etc``
``SHAREDSTATE``         ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_SHARESTATEDIR}`` ``com``
``LOCALSTATE``          ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LOCALSTATEDIR}`` ``var``
``RUNSTATE``            ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_RUNSTATEDIR}``   ``<LOCALSTATE dir>/run``
``DATA``                ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_DATADIR}``       ``<DATAROOT dir>``
``INFO``                ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_INFODIR}``       ``<DATAROOT dir>/info``
``LOCALE``              ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_LOCALEDIR}``     ``<DATAROOT dir>/locale``
``MAN``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_MANDIR}``        ``<DATAROOT dir>/man``
``DOC``                 ``${CMAKE_INSTALL_DOCDIR}``        ``<DATAROOT dir>/doc``
======================= ================================== =========================

Note that some of the types' built-in defaults use the ``DATAROOT`` directory as
a prefix. The ``DATAROOT`` prefix is calculated similarly to the types, with
``CMAKE_INSTALL_DATAROOTDIR`` as the variable and ``share`` as the built-in
default. You cannot use ``DATAROOT`` as a ``TYPE`` parameter; please use
``DATA`` instead.

To make packages compliant with distribution filesystem layout policies, if
projects must specify a ``DESTINATION``, it is recommended that they use a
path that begins with the appropriate ``GNUInstallDirs`` variable.
This allows package maintainers to control the install destination by setting
the appropriate cache variables.

The list of ``dirs...`` given to ``DIRECTORY`` and an install destination
given as a ``DESTINATION`` argument may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.

Custom Installation Logic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 install([[SCRIPT <file>] [CODE <code>]]
         [COMPONENT <component>] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [...])

The ``SCRIPT`` form will invoke the given CMake script files during
installation.  If the script file name is a relative path it will be
interpreted with respect to the current source directory.  The ``CODE``
form will invoke the given CMake code during installation.  Code is
specified as a single argument inside a double-quoted string.  For
example, the code

 install(CODE "MESSAGE(\"Sample install message.\")")

will print a message during installation.

``<file>`` or ``<code>`` may use "generator expressions" with the syntax
``$<...>`` (in the case of ``<file>``, this refers to their use in the file
name, not the file's contents).  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.

Installing Exports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 install(EXPORT <export-name> DESTINATION <dir>
         [NAMESPACE <namespace>] [[FILE <name>.cmake]|
         [PERMISSIONS permissions...]
         [CONFIGURATIONS [Debug|Release|...]]
         [EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES]
         [COMPONENT <component>]
         [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL])
 install(EXPORT_ANDROID_MK <export-name> DESTINATION <dir> [...])

The ``EXPORT`` form generates and installs a CMake file containing code to
import targets from the installation tree into another project.
Target installations are associated with the export ``<export-name>``
using the ``EXPORT`` option of the install(TARGETS) signature
documented above.  The ``NAMESPACE`` option will prepend ``<namespace>`` to
the target names as they are written to the import file.  By default
the generated file will be called ``<export-name>.cmake`` but the ``FILE``
option may be used to specify a different name.  The value given to
the ``FILE`` option must be a file name with the ``.cmake`` extension.
If a ``CONFIGURATIONS`` option is given then the file will only be installed
when one of the named configurations is installed.  Additionally, the
generated import file will reference only the matching target
configurations.  The ``EXPORT_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` keyword, if
present, causes the contents of the properties matching
``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` to be exported, when
policy ``CMP0022`` is ``NEW``.

When a ``COMPONENT`` option is given, the listed ``<component>`` implicitly
depends on all components mentioned in the export set. The exported
``<name>.cmake`` file will require each of the exported components to be
present in order for dependent projects to build properly. For example, a
project may define components ``Runtime`` and ``Development``, with shared
libraries going into the ``Runtime`` component and static libraries and
headers going into the ``Development`` component. The export set would also
typically be part of the ``Development`` component, but it would export
targets from both the ``Runtime`` and ``Development`` components. Therefore,
the ``Runtime`` component would need to be installed if the ``Development``
component was installed, but not vice versa. If the ``Development`` component
was installed without the ``Runtime`` component, dependent projects that try
to link against it would have build errors. Package managers, such as APT and
RPM, typically handle this by listing the ``Runtime`` component as a dependency
of the ``Development`` component in the package metadata, ensuring that the
library is always installed if the headers and CMake export file are present.

In addition to cmake language files, the ``EXPORT_ANDROID_MK`` mode maybe
used to specify an export to the android ndk build system.  This mode
accepts the same options as the normal export mode.  The Android
NDK supports the use of prebuilt libraries, both static and shared. This
allows cmake to build the libraries of a project and make them available
to an ndk build system complete with transitive dependencies, include flags
and defines required to use the libraries.

The ``EXPORT`` form is useful to help outside projects use targets built
and installed by the current project.  For example, the code

 install(TARGETS myexe EXPORT myproj DESTINATION bin)
 install(EXPORT myproj NAMESPACE mp_ DESTINATION lib/myproj)
 install(EXPORT_ANDROID_MK myproj DESTINATION share/ndk-modules)

will install the executable ``myexe`` to ``<prefix>/bin`` and code to import
it in the file ``<prefix>/lib/myproj/myproj.cmake`` and
``<prefix>/share/ndk-modules/Android.mk``.  An outside project
may load this file with the include command and reference the ``myexe``
executable from the installation tree using the imported target name
``mp_myexe`` as if the target were built in its own tree.

.. note::
  This command supercedes the ``install_targets()`` command and
  the ``PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` and ``POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT``
  target properties.  It also replaces the ``FILES`` forms of the
  ``install_files()`` and ``install_programs()`` commands.
  The processing order of these install rules relative to
  those generated by ``install_targets()``,
  ``install_files()``, and ``install_programs()`` commands
  is not defined.

Generated Installation Script
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``install()`` command generates a file, ``cmake_install.cmake``, inside
the build directory, which is used internally by the generated install target
and by CPack. You can also invoke this script manually with ``cmake -P``. This
script accepts several variables:

``COMPONENT``
  Set this variable to install only a single CPack component as opposed to all
  of them. For example, if you only want to install the ``Development``
  component, run ``cmake -DCOMPONENT=Development -P cmake_install.cmake``.

``BUILD_TYPE``
  Set this variable to change the build type if you are using a multi-config
  generator. For example, to install with the ``Debug`` configuration, run
  ``cmake -DBUILD_TYPE=Debug -P cmake_install.cmake``.

``DESTDIR``
  This is an environment variable rather than a CMake variable. It allows you
  to change the installation prefix on UNIX systems. See ``DESTDIR`` for
  details.

link_directories
----------------

Add directories in which the linker will look for libraries.

 link_directories([AFTER|BEFORE] directory1 [directory2 ...])

Adds the paths in which the linker should search for libraries.
Relative paths given to this command are interpreted as relative to
the current source directory, see ``CMP0015``.

The directories are added to the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` directory
property for the current ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, converting relative
paths to absolute as needed.
The command will apply only to targets created after it is called.

By default the directories specified are appended onto the current list of
directories.  This default behavior can be changed by setting
``CMAKE_LINK_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE`` to ``ON``.  By using
``AFTER`` or ``BEFORE`` explicitly, you can select between appending and
prepending, independent of the default.

Arguments to ``link_directories`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax "$<...>".  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::

  This command is rarely necessary and should be avoided where there are
  other choices.  Prefer to pass full absolute paths to libraries where
  possible, since this ensures the correct library will always be linked.
  The ``find_library()`` command provides the full path, which can
  generally be used directly in calls to ``target_link_libraries()``.
  Situations where a library search path may be needed include:

  - Project generators like Xcode where the user can switch target
    architecture at build time, but a full path to a library cannot
    be used because it only provides one architecture (i.e. it is not
    a universal binary).
  - Libraries may themselves have other private library dependencies
    that expect to be found via ``RPATH`` mechanisms, but some linkers
    are not able to fully decode those paths (e.g. due to the presence
    of things like ``$ORIGIN``).

  If a library search path must be provided, prefer to localize the effect
  where possible by using the ``target_link_directories()`` command
  rather than ``link_directories()``.  The target-specific command can also
  control how the search directories propagate to other dependent targets.

link_libraries
--------------

Link libraries to all targets added later.

 link_libraries([item1 [item2 [...]]]
                [[debug|optimized|general] <item>] ...)

Specify libraries or flags to use when linking any targets created later in
the current directory or below by commands such as ``add_executable()``
or ``add_library()``.  See the ``target_link_libraries()`` command
for meaning of arguments.

.. note::
  The ``target_link_libraries()`` command should be preferred whenever
  possible.  Library dependencies are chained automatically, so directory-wide
  specification of link libraries is rarely needed.

load_cache
----------

Load in the values from another project's CMake cache.

 load_cache(pathToCacheFile READ_WITH_PREFIX prefix entry1...)

Reads the cache and store the requested entries in variables with their
name prefixed with the given prefix.  This only reads the values, and
does not create entries in the local project's cache.

 load_cache(pathToCacheFile [EXCLUDE entry1...]
            [INCLUDE_INTERNALS entry1...])

Loads in the values from another cache and store them in the local
project's cache as internal entries.  This is useful for a project
that depends on another project built in a different tree.  ``EXCLUDE``
option can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded.
``INCLUDE_INTERNALS`` can be used to provide a list of internal entries to
be included.  Normally, no internal entries are brought in.  Use of
this form of the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided
for backward compatibility.

project
-------

Set the name of the project.

Synopsis
^^^^^^^^

 project(<PROJECT-NAME> [<language-name>...])
 project(<PROJECT-NAME>
         [VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]
         [DESCRIPTION <project-description-string>]
         [HOMEPAGE_URL <url-string>]
         [LANGUAGES <language-name>...])

Sets the name of the project, and stores it in the variable
``PROJECT_NAME``. When called from the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` also stores the project name in the
variable ``CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME``.

Also sets the variables

* ``PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR``,
  ``<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR``
* ``PROJECT_BINARY_DIR``,
  ``<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR``

Further variables are set by the optional arguments described in the following.
If any of these arguments is not used, then the corresponding variables are
set to the empty string.

Options
^^^^^^^

The options are:

``VERSION <version>``
  Optional; may not be used unless policy ``CMP0048`` is
  set to ``NEW``.

  Takes a ``<version>`` argument composed of non-negative integer components,
  i.e. ``<major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]``,
  and sets the variables

  * ``PROJECT_VERSION``,
    ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION``
  * ``PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR``,
    ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  * ``PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR``,
    ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MINOR``
  * ``PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH``,
    ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_PATCH``
  * ``PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK``,
    ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_TWEAK``.

  When the ``project()`` command is called from the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``,
  then the version is also stored in the variable ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION``.

``DESCRIPTION <project-description-string>``
  Optional.
  Sets the variables

  * ``PROJECT_DESCRIPTION``, ``<PROJECT-NAME>_DESCRIPTION``

  to ``<project-description-string>``.
  It is recommended that this description is a relatively short string,
  usually no more than a few words.

  When the ``project()`` command is called from the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``,
  then the description is also stored in the variable ``CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION``.

``HOMEPAGE_URL <url-string>``
  Optional.
  Sets the variables

  * ``PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL``, ``<PROJECT-NAME>_HOMEPAGE_URL``

  to ``<url-string>``, which should be the canonical home URL for the project.

  When the ``project()`` command is called from the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``,
  then the URL also is stored in the variable ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL``.

``LANGUAGES <language-name>...``
  Optional.
  Can also be specified without ``LANGUAGES`` keyword per the first, short signature.

  Selects which programming languages are needed to build the project.
  Supported languages include ``C``, ``CXX`` (i.e.  C++), ``CUDA``,
  ``OBJC`` (i.e. Objective-C), ``OBJCXX``, ``Fortran``, and ``ASM``.
  By default ``C`` and ``CXX`` are enabled if no language options are given.
  Specify language ``NONE``, or use the ``LANGUAGES`` keyword and list no languages,
  to skip enabling any languages.

  If enabling ``ASM``, list it last so that CMake can check whether
  compilers for other languages like ``C`` work for assembly too.

The variables set through the ``VERSION``, ``DESCRIPTION`` and ``HOMEPAGE_URL``
options are intended for use as default values in package metadata and documentation.

Code Injection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`` variable is set, the file
pointed to by that variable will be included as the first step of the
``project()`` command.

If the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE`` or
``CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE`` variables are set, the files
they point to will be included as the last step of the ``project()`` command.
If both are set, then ``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE`` will be included before
``CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE``.

Usage
^^^^^

The top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for a project must contain a
literal, direct call to the ``project()`` command; loading one
through the ``include()`` command is not sufficient.  If no such
call exists, CMake will issue a warning and pretend there is a
``project(Project)`` at the top to enable the default languages
(``C`` and ``CXX``).

.. note::
  Call the ``project()`` command near the top of the top-level
  ``CMakeLists.txt``, but *after* calling ``cmake_minimum_required()``.
  It is important to establish version and policy settings before invoking
  other commands whose behavior they may affect.
  See also policy ``CMP0000``.

remove_definitions
------------------

Remove -D define flags added by ``add_definitions()``.

 remove_definitions(-DFOO -DBAR ...)

Removes flags (added by ``add_definitions()``) from the compiler
command line for sources in the current directory and below.

set_source_files_properties
---------------------------

Source files can have properties that affect how they are built.

 set_source_files_properties([file1 [file2 [...]]]
                             PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                             [prop2 value2 [...]])

Sets properties associated with source files using a key/value paired
list.

See also the ``set_property(SOURCE)`` command.

See :ref:`Source File Properties` for the list of properties known
to CMake.  Source file properties are visible only to targets added
in the same directory (``CMakeLists.txt``).

set_target_properties
---------------------

Targets can have properties that affect how they are built.

 set_target_properties(target1 target2 ...
                       PROPERTIES prop1 value1
                       prop2 value2 ...)

Sets properties on targets.  The syntax for the command is to list all
the targets you want to change, and then provide the values you want to
set next.  You can use any prop value pair you want and extract it
later with the ``get_property()`` or ``get_target_property()``
command.

See also the ``set_property(TARGET)`` command.

See :ref:`Target Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake.

set_tests_properties
--------------------

Set a property of the tests.

 set_tests_properties(test1 [test2...] PROPERTIES prop1 value1 prop2 value2)

Sets a property for the tests.  If the test is not found, CMake
will report an error.
``Generator expressions`` will be
expanded the same as supported by the test's ``add_test()`` call.

See also the ``set_property(TEST)`` command.

See :ref:`Test Properties` for the list of properties known to CMake.

source_group
------------

Define a grouping for source files in IDE project generation.
There are two different signatures to create source groups.

 source_group(<name> [FILES <src>...] [REGULAR_EXPRESSION <regex>])
 source_group(TREE <root> [PREFIX <prefix>] [FILES <src>...])

Defines a group into which sources will be placed in project files.
This is intended to set up file tabs in Visual Studio.
The options are:

``TREE``
 CMake will automatically detect, from ``<src>`` files paths, source groups
 it needs to create, to keep structure of source groups analogically to the
 actual files and directories structure in the project. Paths of ``<src>``
 files will be cut to be relative to ``<root>``.

``PREFIX``
 Source group and files located directly in ``<root>`` path, will be placed
 in ``<prefix>`` source groups.

``FILES``
 Any source file specified explicitly will be placed in group
 ``<name>``.  Relative paths are interpreted with respect to the
 current source directory.

``REGULAR_EXPRESSION``
 Any source file whose name matches the regular expression will
 be placed in group ``<name>``.

If a source file matches multiple groups, the *last* group that
explicitly lists the file with ``FILES`` will be favored, if any.
If no group explicitly lists the file, the *last* group whose
regular expression matches the file will be favored.

The ``<name>`` of the group and ``<prefix>`` argument may contain backslashes
to specify subgroups:

 source_group(outer\\inner ...)
 source_group(TREE <root> PREFIX sources\\inc ...)

For backwards compatibility, the short-hand signature

 source_group(<name> <regex>)

is equivalent to

 source_group(<name> REGULAR_EXPRESSION <regex>)

target_compile_definitions
--------------------------

Add compile definitions to a target.

 target_compile_definitions(<target>
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specifies compile definitions to use when compiling a given ``<target>``.  The
named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property of
``<target>``. ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify compile definitions.  Repeated calls for the
same ``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_compile_definitions`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Any leading ``-D`` on an item will be removed.  Empty items are ignored.
For example, the following are all equivalent:

 target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC FOO)
 target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -DFOO)  # -D removed
 target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC "" FOO) # "" ignored
 target_compile_definitions(foo PUBLIC -D FOO) # -D becomes "", then ignored

target_compile_features
-----------------------

Add expected compiler features to a target.

 target_compile_features(<target> <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <feature> [...])

Specifies compiler features required when compiling a given target.  If the
feature is not listed in the ``CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES`` variable
or ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES`` variable,
then an error will be reported by CMake.  If the use of the feature requires
an additional compiler flag, such as ``-std=gnu++11``, the flag will be added
automatically.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the features.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` items will
populate the ``COMPILE_FEATURES`` property of ``<target>``.
``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append items.

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

Arguments to ``target_compile_features`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.
See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available
expressions.  See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for
information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.

target_compile_options
----------------------

Add compile options to a target.

 target_compile_options(<target> [BEFORE]
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Adds options to the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` or
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` target properties. These options
are used when compiling the given ``<target>``, which must have been
created by a command such as ``add_executable()`` or
``add_library()`` and must not be an :ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

Arguments
^^^^^^^^^

If ``BEFORE`` is specified, the content will be prepended to the property
instead of being appended.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` property of
``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify compile options.  Repeated calls for the same
``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_compile_options`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The final set of compile or link options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.
While beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, ``-D A -D B`` becomes ``-D A B``.  One may
specify a group of options using shell-like quoting along with a ``SHELL:``
prefix.  The ``SHELL:`` prefix is dropped, and the rest of the option string
is parsed using the ``separate_arguments()`` ``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode.
For example, ``"SHELL:-D A" "SHELL:-D B"`` becomes ``-D A -D B``.

This command can be used to add any options. However, for adding
preprocessor definitions and include directories it is recommended
to use the more specific commands ``target_compile_definitions()``
and ``target_include_directories()``.

For directory-wide settings, there is the command ``add_compile_options()``.

target_include_directories
--------------------------

Add include directories to a target.

 target_include_directories(<target> [SYSTEM] [BEFORE]
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specifies include directories to use when compiling a given target.
The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such
as ``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

If ``BEFORE`` is specified, the content will be prepended to the property
instead of being appended.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to specify
the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` items will
populate the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` property of ``<target>``.
``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify include directories.

Specified include directories may be absolute paths or relative paths.
Repeated calls for the same <target> append items in the order called.  If
``SYSTEM`` is specified, the compiler will be told the
directories are meant as system include directories on some platforms
(signalling this setting might achieve effects such as the compiler
skipping warnings, or these fixed-install system files not being
considered in dependency calculations - see compiler docs).  If ``SYSTEM``
is used together with ``PUBLIC`` or ``INTERFACE``, the
``INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property will be
populated with the specified directories.

Arguments to ``target_include_directories`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

 target_include_directories(mylib PUBLIC
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>  # <prefix>/include/mylib
 )

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Note that it is not advisable to populate the ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` of the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of a target with absolute paths to the include
directories of dependencies.  That would hard-code into installed packages
the include directory paths for dependencies
**as found on the machine the package was made on**.

The ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` of the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` is only
suitable for specifying the required include directories for headers
provided with the target itself, not those provided by the transitive
dependencies listed in its ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` target
property.  Those dependencies should themselves be targets that specify
their own header locations in ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

target_link_directories
-----------------------

Add link directories to a target.

 target_link_directories(<target> [BEFORE]
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specifies the paths in which the linker should search for libraries when
linking a given target.  Each item can be an absolute or relative path,
with the latter being interpreted as relative to the current source
directory.  These items will be added to the link command.

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the items that follow them.  ``PRIVATE`` and
``PUBLIC`` items will populate the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` property
of ``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES`` property of ``<target>``
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items).
Each item specifies a link directory and will be converted to an absolute
path if necessary before adding it to the relevant property.  Repeated
calls for the same ``<target>`` append items in the order called.

If ``BEFORE`` is specified, the content will be prepended to the relevant
property instead of being appended.

Arguments to ``target_link_directories`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::

  This command is rarely necessary and should be avoided where there are
  other choices.  Prefer to pass full absolute paths to libraries where
  possible, since this ensures the correct library will always be linked.
  The ``find_library()`` command provides the full path, which can
  generally be used directly in calls to ``target_link_libraries()``.
  Situations where a library search path may be needed include:

  - Project generators like Xcode where the user can switch target
    architecture at build time, but a full path to a library cannot
    be used because it only provides one architecture (i.e. it is not
    a universal binary).
  - Libraries may themselves have other private library dependencies
    that expect to be found via ``RPATH`` mechanisms, but some linkers
    are not able to fully decode those paths (e.g. due to the presence
    of things like ``$ORIGIN``).

target_link_libraries
---------------------

Specify libraries or flags to use when linking a given target and/or
its dependents.  :ref:`Usage requirements <Target Usage Requirements>`
from linked library targets will be propagated.  Usage requirements
of a target's dependencies affect compilation of its own sources.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This command has several signatures as detailed in subsections below.
All of them have the general form

 target_link_libraries(<target> ... <item>... ...)

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.  If policy ``CMP0079`` is not
set to ``NEW`` then the target must have been created in the current
directory.  Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append items in
the order called.

Each ``<item>`` may be:

* **A library target name**: The generated link line will have the
  full path to the linkable library file associated with the target.
  The buildsystem will have a dependency to re-link ``<target>`` if
  the library file changes.

  The named target must be created by ``add_library()`` within
  the project or as an :ref:`IMPORTED library <Imported Targets>`.
  If it is created within the project an ordering dependency will
  automatically be added in the build system to make sure the named
  library target is up-to-date before the ``<target>`` links.

  If an imported library has the ``IMPORTED_NO_SONAME``
  target property set, CMake may ask the linker to search for
  the library instead of using the full path
  (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` becomes ``-lfoo``).

  The full path to the target's artifact will be quoted/escaped for
  the shell automatically.

* **A full path to a library file**: The generated link line will
  normally preserve the full path to the file. The buildsystem will
  have a dependency to re-link ``<target>`` if the library file changes.

  There are some cases where CMake may ask the linker to search for
  the library (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` becomes ``-lfoo``), such
  as when a shared library is detected to have no ``SONAME`` field.
  See policy ``CMP0060`` for discussion of another case.

  If the library file is in a macOS framework, the ``Headers`` directory
  of the framework will also be processed as a
  :ref:`usage requirement <Target Usage Requirements>`.  This has the same
  effect as passing the framework directory as an include directory.

  On :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above, library files
  ending in ``.targets`` will be treated as MSBuild targets files and
  imported into generated project files.  This is not supported by other
  generators.

  The full path to the library file will be quoted/escaped for
  the shell automatically.

* **A plain library name**: The generated link line will ask the linker
  to search for the library (e.g. ``foo`` becomes ``-lfoo`` or ``foo.lib``).

  The library name/flag is treated as a command-line string fragment and
  will be used with no extra quoting or escaping.

* **A link flag**: Item names starting with ``-``, but not ``-l`` or
  ``-framework``, are treated as linker flags.  Note that such flags will
  be treated like any other library link item for purposes of transitive
  dependencies, so they are generally safe to specify only as private link
  items that will not propagate to dependents.

  Link flags specified here are inserted into the link command in the same
  place as the link libraries. This might not be correct, depending on
  the linker. Use the ``LINK_OPTIONS`` target property or
  ``target_link_options()`` command to add link
  flags explicitly. The flags will then be placed at the toolchain-defined
  flag position in the link command.

  The link flag is treated as a command-line string fragment and
  will be used with no extra quoting or escaping.

* **A generator expression**: A ``$<...>`` :manual:`generator expression
  <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` may evaluate to any of the above
  items or to a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of them.
  If the ``...`` contains any ``;`` characters, e.g. after evaluation
  of a ``${list}`` variable, be sure to use an explicitly quoted
  argument ``"$<...>"`` so that this command receives it as a
  single ``<item>``.

  Additionally, a generator expression may be used as a fragment of
  any of the above items, e.g. ``foo$<1:_d>``.

  Note that generator expressions will not be used in OLD handling of
  policy ``CMP0003`` or policy ``CMP0004``.

* A ``debug``, ``optimized``, or ``general`` keyword immediately followed
  by another ``<item>``.  The item following such a keyword will be used
  only for the corresponding build configuration.  The ``debug`` keyword
  corresponds to the ``Debug`` configuration (or to configurations named
  in the ``DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS`` global property if it is set).
  The ``optimized`` keyword corresponds to all other configurations.  The
  ``general`` keyword corresponds to all configurations, and is purely
  optional.  Higher granularity may be achieved for per-configuration
  rules by creating and linking to
  :ref:`IMPORTED library targets <Imported Targets>`.
  These keywords are interpreted immediately by this command and therefore
  have no special meaning when produced by a generator expression.

Items containing ``::``, such as ``Foo::Bar``, are assumed to be
:ref:`IMPORTED <Imported Targets>` or :ref:`ALIAS <Alias Targets>` library
target names and will cause an error if no such target exists.
See policy ``CMP0028``.

See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.

Libraries for a Target and/or its Dependents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 target_link_libraries(<target>
                       <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <item>...
                      [<PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> <item>...]...)

The ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE`` and ``INTERFACE`` keywords can be used to
specify both the link dependencies and the link interface in one command.
Libraries and targets following ``PUBLIC`` are linked to, and are made
part of the link interface.  Libraries and targets following ``PRIVATE``
are linked to, but are not made part of the link interface.  Libraries
following ``INTERFACE`` are appended to the link interface and are not
used for linking ``<target>``.

Libraries for both a Target and its Dependents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 target_link_libraries(<target> <item>...)

Library dependencies are transitive by default with this signature.
When this target is linked into another target then the libraries
linked to this target will appear on the link line for the other
target too.  This transitive "link interface" is stored in the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` target property and may be overridden
by setting the property directly.  When ``CMP0022`` is not set to
``NEW``, transitive linking is built in but may be overridden by the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` property.  Calls to other signatures
of this command may set the property making any libraries linked
exclusively by this signature private.

Libraries for a Target and/or its Dependents (Legacy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 target_link_libraries(<target>
                       <LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC> <lib>...
                      [<LINK_PRIVATE|LINK_PUBLIC> <lib>...]...)

The ``LINK_PUBLIC`` and ``LINK_PRIVATE`` modes can be used to specify both
the link dependencies and the link interface in one command.

This signature is for compatibility only.  Prefer the ``PUBLIC`` or
``PRIVATE`` keywords instead.

Libraries and targets following ``LINK_PUBLIC`` are linked to, and are
made part of the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``.  If policy
``CMP0022`` is not ``NEW``, they are also made part of the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES``.  Libraries and targets following
``LINK_PRIVATE`` are linked to, but are not made part of the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` (or ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES``).

Libraries for Dependents Only (Legacy)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 target_link_libraries(<target> LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES <item>...)

The ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` mode appends the libraries to the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` target property instead of using them
for linking.  If policy ``CMP0022`` is not ``NEW``, then this mode
also appends libraries to the ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` and its
per-configuration equivalent.

This signature is for compatibility only.  Prefer the ``INTERFACE`` mode
instead.

Libraries specified as ``debug`` are wrapped in a generator expression to
correspond to debug builds.  If policy ``CMP0022`` is
not ``NEW``, the libraries are also appended to the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_DEBUG``
property (or to the properties corresponding to configurations listed in
the ``DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS`` global property if it is set).
Libraries specified as ``optimized`` are appended to the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property.  If policy ``CMP0022``
is not ``NEW``, they are also appended to the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` property.  Libraries specified as
``general`` (or without any keyword) are treated as if specified for both
``debug`` and ``optimized``.

Linking Object Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

:ref:`Object Libraries` may be used as the ``<target>`` (first) argument
of ``target_link_libraries`` to specify dependencies of their sources
on other libraries.  For example, the code

 add_library(A SHARED a.c)
 target_compile_definitions(A PUBLIC A)

 add_library(obj OBJECT obj.c)
 target_compile_definitions(obj PUBLIC OBJ)
 target_link_libraries(obj PUBLIC A)

compiles ``obj.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ`` and establishes usage requirements
for ``obj`` that propagate to its dependents.

Normal libraries and executables may link to :ref:`Object Libraries`
to get their objects and usage requirements.  Continuing the above
example, the code

 add_library(B SHARED b.c)
 target_link_libraries(B PUBLIC obj)

compiles ``b.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ``, creates shared library ``B``
with object files from ``b.c`` and ``obj.c``, and links ``B`` to ``A``.
Furthermore, the code

 add_executable(main main.c)
 target_link_libraries(main B)

compiles ``main.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ`` and links executable ``main``
to ``B`` and ``A``.  The object library's usage requirements are
propagated transitively through ``B``, but its object files are not.

:ref:`Object Libraries` may "link" to other object libraries to get
usage requirements, but since they do not have a link step nothing
is done with their object files.  Continuing from the above example,
the code:

 add_library(obj2 OBJECT obj2.c)
 target_link_libraries(obj2 PUBLIC obj)

 add_executable(main2 main2.c)
 target_link_libraries(main2 obj2)

compiles ``obj2.c`` with ``-DA -DOBJ``, creates executable ``main2``
with object files from ``main2.c`` and ``obj2.c``, and links ``main2``
to ``A``.

In other words, when :ref:`Object Libraries` appear in a target's
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property they will be
treated as :ref:`Interface Libraries`, but when they appear in
a target's ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` property their object files
will be included in the link too.

Cyclic Dependencies of Static Libraries
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The library dependency graph is normally acyclic (a DAG), but in the case
of mutually-dependent ``STATIC`` libraries CMake allows the graph to
contain cycles (strongly connected components).  When another target links
to one of the libraries, CMake repeats the entire connected component.
For example, the code

 add_library(A STATIC a.c)
 add_library(B STATIC b.c)
 target_link_libraries(A B)
 target_link_libraries(B A)
 add_executable(main main.c)
 target_link_libraries(main A)

links ``main`` to ``A B A B``.  While one repetition is usually
sufficient, pathological object file and symbol arrangements can require
more.  One may handle such cases by using the
``LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY`` target property or by manually
repeating the component in the last ``target_link_libraries`` call.
However, if two archives are really so interdependent they should probably
be combined into a single archive, perhaps by using :ref:`Object Libraries`.

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Note that it is not advisable to populate the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies **as found on the machine the package was made on**.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

target_link_options
-------------------

Add options to the link step for an executable, shared library or module
library target.

 target_link_options(<target> [BEFORE]
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

This command can be used to add any link options, but alternative commands
exist to add libraries (``target_link_libraries()`` or
``link_libraries()``).  See documentation of the
``directory`` and
``target`` ``LINK_OPTIONS`` properties.

.. note::

  This command cannot be used to add options for static library targets,
  since they do not use a linker.  To add archiver or MSVC librarian flags,
  see the ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS`` target property.

If ``BEFORE`` is specified, the content will be prepended to the property
instead of being appended.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the ``LINK_OPTIONS`` property of
``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify link options.  Repeated calls for the same
``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_link_options`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The final set of compile or link options used for a target is constructed by
accumulating options from the current target and the usage requirements of
its dependencies.  The set of options is de-duplicated to avoid repetition.
While beneficial for individual options, the de-duplication step can break
up option groups.  For example, ``-D A -D B`` becomes ``-D A B``.  One may
specify a group of options using shell-like quoting along with a ``SHELL:``
prefix.  The ``SHELL:`` prefix is dropped, and the rest of the option string
is parsed using the ``separate_arguments()`` ``UNIX_COMMAND`` mode.
For example, ``"SHELL:-D A" "SHELL:-D B"`` becomes ``-D A -D B``.

To pass options to the linker tool, each compiler driver has its own syntax.
The ``LINKER:`` prefix and ``,`` separator can be used to specify, in a portable
way, options to pass to the linker tool. ``LINKER:`` is replaced by the
appropriate driver option and ``,`` by the appropriate driver separator.
The driver prefix and driver separator are given by the values of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG`` and
``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP`` variables.

For example, ``"LINKER:-z,defs"`` becomes ``-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs`` for
``Clang`` and ``-Wl,-z,defs`` for ``GNU GCC``.

The ``LINKER:`` prefix can be specified as part of a ``SHELL:`` prefix
expression.

The ``LINKER:`` prefix supports, as an alternative syntax, specification of
arguments using the ``SHELL:`` prefix and space as separator. The previous
example then becomes ``"LINKER:SHELL:-z defs"``.

.. note::

  Specifying the ``SHELL:`` prefix anywhere other than at the beginning of the
  ``LINKER:`` prefix is not supported.

target_precompile_headers
-------------------------

Add a list of header files to precompile.

 target_precompile_headers(<target>
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [header1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [header2...] ...])

 target_precompile_headers(<target> REUSE_FROM <other_target>)

Adds header files to ``PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` or
``INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` target properties.

The second signature will reuse an already precompiled header file artefact
from another target. This is done by setting the
``PRECOMPILE_HEADERS_REUSE_FROM`` to ``<other_target>`` value.
The ``<other_target>`` will become a dependency of ``<target>``.

.. note::

  The second signature will require the same set of compiler options,
  compiler flags, compiler definitions for both ``<target>``, and
  ``<other_target>``. Compilers (e.g. GCC) will issue a warning if the
  precompiled header file cannot be used (``-Winvalid-pch``).

Precompiling header files can speed up compilation by creating a partially
processed version of some header files, and then using that version during
compilations rather than repeatedly parsing the original headers.

The named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the ``PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` property of
``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
Repeated calls for the same ``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_precompile_headers`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.
See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available
expressions.  See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for
information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.
The ``$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:...>`` generator expression is particularly
useful for specifying a language-specific header to precompile for
only one language (e.g. ``CXX`` and not ``C``).

Usage
^^^^^

 target_precompile_headers(<target>
   PUBLIC
     project_header.h
     "$<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:cxx_only.h>"
   PRIVATE
     [["other_header.h"]]
     <unordered_map>
 )

The list of header files is used to generate a header file named
``cmake_pch.h|xx`` which is used to generate the precompiled header file
(``.pch``, ``.gch``, ``.pchi``) artifact.  The ``cmake_pch.h|xx`` header
file will be force included (``-include`` for GCC, ``/FI`` for MSVC) to
all source files, so sources do not need to have ``#include "pch.h"``.

Header file names specified with angle brackets (e.g. ``<unordered_map>``) or
explicit double quotes (escaped for the ``cmake-language(7)``,
e.g. ``[["other_header.h"]]``) will be treated as is, and include directories
must be available for the compiler to find them.  Other header file names
(e.g. ``project_header.h``) are interpreted as being relative to the current
source directory (e.g. ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``) and will be
included by absolute path.

See Also
^^^^^^^^

For disabling precompile headers for specific targets there is the
property ``DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS``.

For skipping certain source files there is the source file property
``SKIP_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS``.

target_sources
--------------

Add sources to a target.

 target_sources(<target>
   <INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items1...]
   [<INTERFACE|PUBLIC|PRIVATE> [items2...] ...])

Specifies sources to use when compiling a given target.  Relative
source file paths are interpreted as being relative to the current
source directory (i.e. ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``).  The
named ``<target>`` must have been created by a command such as
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` and must not be an
:ref:`ALIAS target <Alias Targets>`.

The ``INTERFACE``, ``PUBLIC`` and ``PRIVATE`` keywords are required to
specify the scope of the following arguments.  ``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC``
items will populate the ``SOURCES`` property of
``<target>``.  ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` items will populate the
``INTERFACE_SOURCES`` property of ``<target>``.
(:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` only support ``INTERFACE`` items.)
The following arguments specify sources.  Repeated calls for the same
``<target>`` append items in the order called.

Arguments to ``target_sources`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

See also the ``CMP0076`` policy for older behavior related to the
handling of relative source file paths.

try_compile
-----------

Try building some code.

Try Compiling Whole Projects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 try_compile(<resultVar> <bindir> <srcdir>
             <projectName> [<targetName>] [CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...]
             [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>])

Try building a project.  The success or failure of the ``try_compile``,
i.e. ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` respectively, is returned in ``<resultVar>``.

In this form, ``<srcdir>`` should contain a complete CMake project with a
``CMakeLists.txt`` file and all sources.  The ``<bindir>`` and ``<srcdir>``
will not be deleted after this command is run.  Specify ``<targetName>`` to
build a specific target instead of the ``all`` or ``ALL_BUILD`` target.  See
below for the meaning of other options.

Try Compiling Source Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 try_compile(<resultVar> <bindir> <srcfile|SOURCES srcfile...>
             [CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...]
             [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...]
             [LINK_OPTIONS <options>...]
             [LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...]
             [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
             [COPY_FILE <fileName> [COPY_FILE_ERROR <var>]]
             [<LANG>_STANDARD <std>]
             [<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED <bool>]
             [<LANG>_EXTENSIONS <bool>]
             )

Try building an executable or static library from one or more source files
(which one is determined by the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE``
variable).  The success or failure of the ``try_compile``, i.e. ``TRUE`` or
``FALSE`` respectively, is returned in ``<resultVar>``.

In this form, one or more source files must be provided.  If
``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` is unset or is set to ``EXECUTABLE``,
the sources must include a definition for ``main`` and CMake will create a
``CMakeLists.txt`` file to build the source(s) as an executable.
If ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` is set to ``STATIC_LIBRARY``,
a static library will be built instead and no definition for ``main`` is
required.  For an executable, the generated ``CMakeLists.txt`` file would
contain something like the following:

 add_definitions(<expanded COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from caller>)
 include_directories(${INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES})
 link_directories(${LINK_DIRECTORIES})
 add_executable(cmTryCompileExec <srcfile>...)
 target_link_options(cmTryCompileExec PRIVATE <LINK_OPTIONS from caller>)
 target_link_libraries(cmTryCompileExec ${LINK_LIBRARIES})

The options are:

``CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...``
  Specify flags of the form ``-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE`` to be passed to
  the ``cmake`` command-line used to drive the test build.
  The above example shows how values for variables
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``, and ``LINK_LIBRARIES``
  are used.

``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...``
  Specify ``-Ddefinition`` arguments to pass to ``add_definitions()``
  in the generated test project.

``COPY_FILE <fileName>``
  Copy the built executable or static library to the given ``<fileName>``.

``COPY_FILE_ERROR <var>``
  Use after ``COPY_FILE`` to capture into variable ``<var>`` any error
  message encountered while trying to copy the file.

``LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...``
  Specify libraries to be linked in the generated project.
  The list of libraries may refer to system libraries and to
  :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` from the calling project.

  If this option is specified, any ``-DLINK_LIBRARIES=...`` value
  given to the ``CMAKE_FLAGS`` option will be ignored.

``LINK_OPTIONS <options>...``
  Specify link step options to pass to ``target_link_options()`` or to
  set the ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS`` target property in the generated
  project, depending on the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` variable.

``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Store the output from the build process in the given variable.

``<LANG>_STANDARD <std>``
  Specify the ``C_STANDARD``, ``CXX_STANDARD``,
  or ``CUDA_STANDARD`` target property of the generated project.

``<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED <bool>``
  Specify the ``C_STANDARD_REQUIRED``,
  ``CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED``, or ``CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
  target property of the generated project.

``<LANG>_EXTENSIONS <bool>``
  Specify the ``C_EXTENSIONS``, ``CXX_EXTENSIONS``,
  or ``CUDA_EXTENSIONS`` target property of the generated project.

In this version all files in ``<bindir>/CMakeFiles/CMakeTmp`` will be
cleaned automatically.  For debugging, ``--debug-trycompile`` can be
passed to ``cmake`` to avoid this clean.  However, multiple sequential
``try_compile`` operations reuse this single output directory.  If you use
``--debug-trycompile``, you can only debug one ``try_compile`` call at a time.
The recommended procedure is to protect all ``try_compile`` calls in your
project by ``if(NOT DEFINED <resultVar>)`` logic, configure with cmake
all the way through once, then delete the cache entry associated with
the try_compile call of interest, and then re-run cmake again with
``--debug-trycompile``.

Other Behavior Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If set, the following variables are passed in to the generated
try_compile CMakeLists.txt to initialize compile target properties with
default values:

* ``CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS``
* ``CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC``
* ``CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC``
* ``CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY``
* ``CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``

If ``CMP0056`` is set to ``NEW``, then
``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`` is passed in as well.

If ``CMP0083`` is set to ``NEW``, then in order to obtain correct
behavior at link time, the ``check_pie_supported()`` command from the
``CheckPIESupported`` module must be called before using the
``try_compile()`` command.

The current settings of ``CMP0065`` and ``CMP0083`` are propagated
through to the generated test project.

Set the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION`` variable to choose
a build configuration.

Set the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` variable to specify
the type of target used for the source file signature.

Set the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES`` variable to specify
variables that must be propagated into the test project.  This variable is
meant for use only in toolchain files and is only honored by the
``try_compile()`` command for the source files form, not when given a whole
project.

If ``CMP0067`` is set to ``NEW``, or any of the ``<LANG>_STANDARD``,
``<LANG>_STANDARD_REQUIRED``, or ``<LANG>_EXTENSIONS`` options are used,
then the language standard variables are honored:

* ``CMAKE_C_STANDARD``
* ``CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
* ``CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS``
* ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD``
* ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
* ``CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS``
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD``
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS``

Their values are used to set the corresponding target properties in
the generated project (unless overridden by an explicit option).

For the ``Green Hills MULTI`` generator the GHS toolset and target
system customization cache variables are also propagated into the test project.

try_run
-------

Try compiling and then running some code.

Try Compiling and Running Source Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 try_run(<runResultVar> <compileResultVar>
         <bindir> <srcfile> [CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...]
         [COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...]
         [LINK_OPTIONS <options>...]
         [LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...]
         [COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
         [RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
         [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
         [ARGS <args>...])

Try compiling a ``<srcfile>``.  Returns ``TRUE`` or ``FALSE`` for success
or failure in ``<compileResultVar>``.  If the compile succeeded, runs the
executable and returns its exit code in ``<runResultVar>``.  If the
executable was built, but failed to run, then ``<runResultVar>`` will be
set to ``FAILED_TO_RUN``.  See the ``try_compile()`` command for
information on how the test project is constructed to build the source file.

The options are:

``CMAKE_FLAGS <flags>...``
  Specify flags of the form ``-DVAR:TYPE=VALUE`` to be passed to
  the ``cmake`` command-line used to drive the test build.
  The example in ``try_compile()`` shows how values for variables
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``, and ``LINK_LIBRARIES``
  are used.

``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS <defs>...``
  Specify ``-Ddefinition`` arguments to pass to ``add_definitions()``
  in the generated test project.

``COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Report the compile step build output in a given variable.

``LINK_LIBRARIES <libs>...``
  Specify libraries to be linked in the generated project.
  The list of libraries may refer to system libraries and to
  :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` from the calling project.

  If this option is specified, any ``-DLINK_LIBRARIES=...`` value
  given to the ``CMAKE_FLAGS`` option will be ignored.

``LINK_OPTIONS <options>...``
  Specify link step options to pass to ``target_link_options()`` in the
  generated project.

``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Report the compile build output and the output from running the executable
  in the given variable.  This option exists for legacy reasons.  Prefer
  ``COMPILE_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` and ``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` instead.

``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>``
  Report the output from running the executable in a given variable.

Other Behavior Settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Set the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION`` variable to choose
a build configuration.

Behavior when Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When cross compiling, the executable compiled in the first step
usually cannot be run on the build host.  The ``try_run`` command checks
the ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` variable to detect whether CMake is in
cross-compiling mode.  If that is the case, it will still try to compile
the executable, but it will not try to run the executable unless the
``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` variable is set.  Instead it
will create cache variables which must be filled by the user or by
presetting them in some CMake script file to the values the executable
would have produced if it had been run on its actual target platform.
These cache entries are:

``<runResultVar>``
  Exit code if the executable were to be run on the target platform.

``<runResultVar>__TRYRUN_OUTPUT``
  Output from stdout and stderr if the executable were to be run on
  the target platform.  This is created only if the
  ``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` or ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` option was used.

In order to make cross compiling your project easier, use ``try_run``
only if really required.  If you use ``try_run``, use the
``RUN_OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` or ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` options only if really
required.  Using them will require that when cross-compiling, the cache
variables will have to be set manually to the output of the executable.
You can also "guard" the calls to ``try_run`` with an ``if()``
block checking the ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` variable and
provide an easy-to-preset alternative for this case.

CTest Commands
==============

These commands are available only in CTest scripts.

ctest_build
-----------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Build Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_build([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
             [CONFIGURATION <config>]
             [FLAGS <flags>]
             [PROJECT_NAME <project-name>]
             [TARGET <target-name>]
             [NUMBER_ERRORS <num-err-var>]
             [NUMBER_WARNINGS <num-warn-var>]
             [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
             [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
             )

Build the project and store results in ``Build.xml``
for submission with the ``ctest_submit()`` command.

The ``CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND`` variable may be set to explicitly
specify the build command line.  Otherwise the build command line is
computed automatically based on the options given.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Build.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last ``ctest_start()`` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``CONFIGURATION <config>``
  Specify the build configuration (e.g. ``Debug``).  If not
  specified the ``CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION`` variable will be checked.
  Otherwise the ``-C <cfg>`` option given to the ``ctest(1)``
  command will be used, if any.

``FLAGS <flags>``
  Pass additional arguments to the underlying build command.
  If not specified the ``CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS`` variable will be checked.
  This can, e.g., be used to trigger a parallel build using the
  ``-j`` option of make. See the ``ProcessorCount`` module
  for an example.

``PROJECT_NAME <project-name>``
  Ignored.  This was once used but is no longer needed.

``TARGET <target-name>``
  Specify the name of a target to build.  If not specified the
  ``CTEST_BUILD_TARGET`` variable will be checked.  Otherwise the
  default target will be built.  This is the "all" target
  (called ``ALL_BUILD`` in :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`).

``NUMBER_ERRORS <num-err-var>``
  Store the number of build errors detected in the given variable.

``NUMBER_WARNINGS <num-warn-var>``
  Store the number of build warnings detected in the given variable.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store the return value of the native build tool in the given variable.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error output that would have been
  printed to the console otherwise.  The summary of warnings / errors,
  as well as the output from the native build tool is unaffected by
  this option.

ctest_configure
---------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Configure Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_configure([BUILD <build-dir>] [SOURCE <source-dir>] [APPEND]
                 [OPTIONS <options>] [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>] [QUIET]
                 [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>])

Configure the project build tree and record results in ``Configure.xml``
for submission with the ``ctest_submit()`` command.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` variable is used.

``SOURCE <source-dir>``
  Specify the source directory.  If not given, the
  ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Configure.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last ``ctest_start()`` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``OPTIONS <options>``
  Specify command-line arguments to pass to the configuration tool.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable the return value of the native
  configuration tool.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error messages that would have
  otherwise been printed to the console.  Output from the underlying
  configure command is not affected.

ctest_coverage
--------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Coverage Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_coverage([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
                [LABELS <label>...]
                [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
                [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
                [QUIET]
                )

Collect coverage tool results and stores them in ``Coverage.xml``
for submission with the ``ctest_submit()`` command.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Coverage.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last ``ctest_start()`` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``LABELS``
  Filter the coverage report to include only source files labeled
  with at least one of the labels specified.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable ``0`` if coverage tools
  ran without error and non-zero otherwise.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error output that would have been
  printed to the console otherwise.  The summary indicating how many
  lines of code were covered is unaffected by this option.

ctest_empty_binary_directory
----------------------------

empties the binary directory

::

 ctest_empty_binary_directory( directory )

Removes a binary directory.  This command will perform some checks
prior to deleting the directory in an attempt to avoid malicious or
accidental directory deletion.

ctest_memcheck
--------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest MemCheck Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_memcheck([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
                [START <start-number>]
                [END <end-number>]
                [STRIDE <stride-number>]
                [EXCLUDE <exclude-regex>]
                [INCLUDE <include-regex>]
                [EXCLUDE_LABEL <label-exclude-regex>]
                [INCLUDE_LABEL <label-include-regex>]
                [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE <regex>]
                [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_SETUP <regex>]
                [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_CLEANUP <regex>]
                [PARALLEL_LEVEL <level>]
                [TEST_LOAD <threshold>]
                [SCHEDULE_RANDOM <ON|OFF>]
                [STOP_TIME <time-of-day>]
                [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
                [DEFECT_COUNT <defect-count-var>]
                [QUIET]
                )

Run tests with a dynamic analysis tool and store results in
``MemCheck.xml`` for submission with the ``ctest_submit()``
command.

Most options are the same as those for the ``ctest_test()`` command.

The options unique to this command are:

``DEFECT_COUNT <defect-count-var>``
  Store in the ``<defect-count-var>`` the number of defects found.

ctest_read_custom_files
-----------------------

read CTestCustom files.

::

 ctest_read_custom_files( directory ... )

Read all the CTestCustom.ctest or CTestCustom.cmake files from the
given directory.

By default, invoking ``ctest(1)`` without a script will read custom
files from the binary directory.

ctest_run_script
----------------

runs a ctest -S script

::

 ctest_run_script([NEW_PROCESS] script_file_name script_file_name1
             script_file_name2 ... [RETURN_VALUE var])

Runs a script or scripts much like if it was run from ctest -S.  If no
argument is provided then the current script is run using the current
settings of the variables.  If ``NEW_PROCESS`` is specified then each
script will be run in a separate process.If ``RETURN_VALUE`` is specified
the return value of the last script run will be put into ``var``.

ctest_sleep
-----------

sleeps for some amount of time

::

 ctest_sleep(<seconds>)

Sleep for given number of seconds.

::

 ctest_sleep(<time1> <duration> <time2>)

Sleep for t=(time1 + duration - time2) seconds if t > 0.

ctest_start
-----------

Starts the testing for a given model

::

 ctest_start(<model> [<source> [<binary>]] [GROUP <group>] [QUIET])

 ctest_start([<model> [<source> [<binary>]]] [GROUP <group>] APPEND [QUIET])

Starts the testing for a given model.  The command should be called
after the binary directory is initialized.

The parameters are as follows:

``<model>``
  Set the dashboard model. Must be one of ``Experimental``, ``Continuous``, or
  ``Nightly``. This parameter is required unless ``APPEND`` is specified.

``<source>``
  Set the source directory. If not specified, the value of
  ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`` is used instead.

``<binary>``
  Set the binary directory. If not specified, the value of
  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` is used instead.

``GROUP <group>``
  If ``GROUP`` is used, the submissions will go to the specified group on the
  CDash server. If no ``GROUP`` is specified, the name of the model is used by
  default. This replaces the deprecated option ``TRACK``. Despite the name
  change its behavior is unchanged.

``APPEND``
  If ``APPEND`` is used, the existing ``TAG`` is used rather than creating a new
  one based on the current time stamp. If you use ``APPEND``, you can omit the
  ``<model>`` and ``GROUP <group>`` parameters, because they will be read from
  the generated ``TAG`` file. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ctest_start(Experimental GROUP GroupExperimental)

  Later, in another ``ctest -S`` script:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ctest_start(APPEND)

  When the second script runs ``ctest_start(APPEND)``, it will read the
  ``Experimental`` model and ``GroupExperimental`` group from the ``TAG`` file
  generated by the first ``ctest_start()`` command. Please note that if you
  call ``ctest_start(APPEND)`` and specify a different model or group than
  in the first ``ctest_start()`` command, a warning will be issued, and the
  new model and group will be used.

``QUIET``
  If ``QUIET`` is used, CTest will suppress any non-error messages that it
  otherwise would have printed to the console.

The parameters for ``ctest_start()`` can be issued in any order, with the
exception that ``<model>``, ``<source>``, and ``<binary>`` have to appear
in that order with respect to each other. The following are all valid and
equivalent:

 ctest_start(Experimental path/to/source path/to/binary GROUP SomeGroup QUIET APPEND)

 ctest_start(GROUP SomeGroup Experimental QUIET path/to/source APPEND path/to/binary)

 ctest_start(APPEND QUIET Experimental path/to/source GROUP SomeGroup path/to/binary)

However, for the sake of readability, it is recommended that you order your
parameters in the order listed at the top of this page.

If the ``CTEST_CHECKOUT_COMMAND`` variable (or the
``CTEST_CVS_CHECKOUT`` variable) is set, its content is treated as
command-line.  The command is invoked with the current working directory set
to the parent of the source directory, even if the source directory already
exists.  This can be used to create the source tree from a version control
repository.

ctest_submit
------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Submit Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_submit([PARTS <part>...] [FILES <file>...]
              [SUBMIT_URL <url>]
              [BUILD_ID <result-var>]
              [HTTPHEADER <header>]
              [RETRY_COUNT <count>]
              [RETRY_DELAY <delay>]
              [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
              [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
              [QUIET]
              )

Submit results to a dashboard server.
By default all available parts are submitted.

The options are:

``PARTS <part>...``
  Specify a subset of parts to submit.  Valid part names are::

 Start      = nothing
 Update     = ctest_update results, in Update.xml
 Configure  = ctest_configure results, in Configure.xml
 Build      = ctest_build results, in Build.xml
 Test       = ctest_test results, in Test.xml
 Coverage   = ctest_coverage results, in Coverage.xml
 MemCheck   = ctest_memcheck results, in DynamicAnalysis.xml
 Notes      = Files listed by CTEST_NOTES_FILES, in Notes.xml
 ExtraFiles = Files listed by CTEST_EXTRA_SUBMIT_FILES
 Upload     = Files prepared for upload by ctest_upload(), in Upload.xml
 Submit     = nothing
 Done       = Build is complete, in Done.xml

``FILES <file>...``
  Specify an explicit list of specific files to be submitted.
  Each individual file must exist at the time of the call.

``SUBMIT_URL <url>``
  The ``http`` or ``https`` URL of the dashboard server to send the submission
  to.  If not given, the ``CTEST_SUBMIT_URL`` variable is used.

``BUILD_ID <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable the ID assigned to this build by
  CDash.

``HTTPHEADER <HTTP-header>``
  Specify HTTP header to be included in the request to CDash during submission.
  For example, CDash can be configured to only accept submissions from
  authenticated clients. In this case, you should provide a bearer token in your
  header:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ctest_submit(HTTPHEADER "Authorization: Bearer <auth-token>")

  This suboption can be repeated several times for multiple headers.

``RETRY_COUNT <count>``
  Specify how many times to retry a timed-out submission.

``RETRY_DELAY <delay>``
  Specify how long (in seconds) to wait after a timed-out submission
  before attempting to re-submit.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable ``0`` for success and
  non-zero on failure.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress all non-error messages that would have otherwise been
  printed to the console.

Submit to CDash Upload API
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

 ctest_submit(CDASH_UPLOAD <file> [CDASH_UPLOAD_TYPE <type>]
              [SUBMIT_URL <url>]
              [HTTPHEADER <header>]
              [RETRY_COUNT <count>]
              [RETRY_DELAY <delay>]
              [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
              [QUIET])

This second signature is used to upload files to CDash via the CDash
file upload API. The API first sends a request to upload to CDash along
with a content hash of the file. If CDash does not already have the file,
then it is uploaded. Along with the file, a CDash type string is specified
to tell CDash which handler to use to process the data.

This signature accepts the ``SUBMIT_URL``, ``BUILD_ID``, ``HTTPHEADER``,
``RETRY_COUNT``, ``RETRY_DELAY``, ``RETURN_VALUE`` and ``QUIET`` options
as described above.

ctest_test
----------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Test Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_test([BUILD <build-dir>] [APPEND]
            [START <start-number>]
            [END <end-number>]

            [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_SETUP <regex>]
            [EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_CLEANUP <regex>]
            [PARALLEL_LEVEL <level>]
            [HARDWARE_SPEC_FILE <file>]
            [TEST_LOAD <threshold>]
            [SCHEDULE_RANDOM <ON|OFF>]
            [STOP_TIME <time-of-day>]
            [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
            [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
            [QUIET]
            )

Run tests in the project build tree and store results in
``Test.xml`` for submission with the ``ctest_submit()`` command.

The options are:

``BUILD <build-dir>``
  Specify the top-level build directory.  If not given, the
  ``CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`` variable is used.

``APPEND``
  Mark ``Test.xml`` for append to results previously submitted to a
  dashboard server since the last ``ctest_start()`` call.
  Append semantics are defined by the dashboard server in use.
  This does *not* cause results to be appended to a ``.xml`` file
  produced by a previous call to this command.

``START <start-number>``
  Specify the beginning of a range of test numbers.

``END <end-number>``
  Specify the end of a range of test numbers.

``STRIDE <stride-number>``
  Specify the stride by which to step across a range of test numbers.

``EXCLUDE <exclude-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test names to exclude.

``INCLUDE <include-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test names to include.
  Tests not matching this expression are excluded.

``EXCLUDE_LABEL <label-exclude-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test labels to exclude.

``INCLUDE_LABEL <label-include-regex>``
  Specify a regular expression matching test labels to include.
  Tests not matching this expression are excluded.

``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE <regex>``
  If a test in the set of tests to be executed requires a particular fixture,
  that fixture's setup and cleanup tests would normally be added to the test
  set automatically. This option prevents adding setup or cleanup tests for
  fixtures matching the ``<regex>``. Note that all other fixture behavior is
  retained, including test dependencies and skipping tests that have fixture
  setup tests that fail.

``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_SETUP <regex>``
  Same as ``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE`` except only matching setup tests are excluded.

``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE_CLEANUP <regex>``
  Same as ``EXCLUDE_FIXTURE`` except only matching cleanup tests are excluded.

``PARALLEL_LEVEL <level>``
  Specify a positive number representing the number of tests to
  be run in parallel.

``HARDWARE_SPEC_FILE <file>``
  Specify a
  :ref:`hardware specification file <ctest-hardware-specification-file>`. See
  :ref:`ctest-hardware-allocation` for more information.

``TEST_LOAD <threshold>``
  While running tests in parallel, try not to start tests when they
  may cause the CPU load to pass above a given threshold.  If not
  specified the ``CTEST_TEST_LOAD`` variable will be checked,
  and then the ``--test-load`` command-line argument to ``ctest(1)``.
  See also the ``TestLoad`` setting in the :ref:`CTest Test Step`.

``SCHEDULE_RANDOM <ON|OFF>``
  Launch tests in a random order.  This may be useful for detecting
  implicit test dependencies.

``STOP_TIME <time-of-day>``
  Specify a time of day at which the tests should all stop running.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable ``0`` if all tests passed.
  Store non-zero if anything went wrong.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error messages that would have otherwise
  been printed to the console.  Output from the underlying test command is not
  affected.  Summary info detailing the percentage of passing tests is also
  unaffected by the ``QUIET`` option.

See also the ``CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_PASSED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE``
and ``CTEST_CUSTOM_MAXIMUM_FAILED_TEST_OUTPUT_SIZE`` variables.

ctest_update
------------

Perform the :ref:`CTest Update Step` as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_update([SOURCE <source-dir>]
              [RETURN_VALUE <result-var>]
              [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>]
              [QUIET])

Update the source tree from version control and record results in
``Update.xml`` for submission with the ``ctest_submit()`` command.

The options are:

``SOURCE <source-dir>``
  Specify the source directory.  If not given, the
  ``CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`` variable is used.

``RETURN_VALUE <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable the number of files
  updated or ``-1`` on error.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

``QUIET``
  Tell CTest to suppress most non-error messages that it would
  have otherwise printed to the console.  CTest will still report
  the new revision of the repository and any conflicting files
  that were found.

The update always follows the version control branch currently checked
out in the source directory.  See the :ref:`CTest Update Step`
documentation for information about variables that change the behavior
of ``ctest_update()``.

ctest_upload
------------

Upload files to a dashboard server as a :ref:`Dashboard Client`.

::

 ctest_upload(FILES <file>... [QUIET] [CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>])

The options are:

``FILES <file>...``
  Specify a list of files to be sent along with the build results to the
  dashboard server.

``QUIET``
  Suppress any CTest-specific non-error output that would have been
  printed to the console otherwise.

``CAPTURE_CMAKE_ERROR <result-var>``
  Store in the ``<result-var>`` variable -1 if there are any errors running
  the command and prevent ctest from returning non-zero if an error occurs.

Deprecated Commands
===================

These commands are deprecated and are only made available to maintain
backward compatibility.  The documentation of each command states the
CMake version in which it was deprecated.  Do not use these commands
in new code.

build_name
----------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0036``.

Use ``${CMAKE_SYSTEM}`` and ``${CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER}`` instead.

::

 build_name(variable)

Sets the specified variable to a string representing the platform and
compiler settings.  These values are now available through the
``CMAKE_SYSTEM`` and
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`` variables.

exec_program
------------

Run an executable program during the processing of the CMakeList.txt
file.

::

 exec_program(Executable [directory in which to run]
              [ARGS <arguments to executable>]
              [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <var>]
              [RETURN_VALUE <var>])

The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The
executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is
better to use the optional ``ARGS`` argument to specify arguments to the
program.  This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in
the executable path.  An optional argument ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` specifies a
variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return value of
the execution, provide a ``RETURN_VALUE``.  If ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` is
specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console
running cmake.

export_library_dependencies
---------------------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0033``.

Use ``install(EXPORT)`` or ``export()`` command.

This command generates an old-style library dependencies file.
Projects requiring CMake 2.6 or later should not use the command.  Use
instead the ``install(EXPORT)`` command to help export targets from an
installation tree and the ``export()`` command to export targets from a
build tree.

The old-style library dependencies file does not take into account
per-configuration names of libraries or the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` target property.

::

 export_library_dependencies(<file> [APPEND])

Create a file named ``<file>`` that can be included into a CMake listfile
with the INCLUDE command.  The file will contain a number of SET
commands that will set all the variables needed for library dependency
information.  This should be the last command in the top level
CMakeLists.txt file of the project.  If the ``APPEND`` option is
specified, the SET commands will be appended to the given file instead
of replacing it.

install_files
-------------

This command has been superceded by the ``install()`` command.  It is
provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The ``FILES`` form is
directly replaced by the ``FILES`` form of the ``install()``
command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the ``GLOB``
form of the ``file()`` command.

::

 install_files(<dir> extension file file ...)

Create rules to install the listed files with the given extension into
the given directory.  Only files existing in the current source tree
or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a
file specified already has an extension, that extension will be
removed first.  This is useful for providing lists of source files
such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed.
A typical extension is ``.h``.

::

 install_files(<dir> regexp)

Any files in the current source directory that match the regular
expression will be installed.

::

 install_files(<dir> FILES file file ...)

Any files listed after the ``FILES`` keyword will be installed explicitly
from the names given.  Full paths are allowed in this form.

The directory ``<dir>`` is relative to the installation prefix, which is
stored in the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

install_programs
----------------

This command has been superceded by the ``install()`` command.  It is
provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The ``FILES`` form is
directly replaced by the ``PROGRAMS`` form of the ``install()``
command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the ``GLOB``
form of the ``file()`` command.

::

 install_programs(<dir> file1 file2 [file3 ...])
 install_programs(<dir> FILES file1 [file2 ...])

Create rules to install the listed programs into the given directory.
Use the ``FILES`` argument to guarantee that the file list version of the
command will be used even when there is only one argument.

::

 install_programs(<dir> regexp)

In the second form any program in the current source directory that
matches the regular expression will be installed.

This command is intended to install programs that are not built by
cmake, such as shell scripts.  See the ``TARGETS`` form of the
``install()`` command to create installation rules for targets built
by cmake.

The directory ``<dir>`` is relative to the installation prefix, which is
stored in the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

install_targets
---------------

This command has been superceded by the ``install()`` command.  It is
provided for compatibility with older CMake code.

::

 install_targets(<dir> [RUNTIME_DIRECTORY dir] target target)

Create rules to install the listed targets into the given directory.
The directory ``<dir>`` is relative to the installation prefix, which is
stored in the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.  If
``RUNTIME_DIRECTORY`` is specified, then on systems with special runtime
files (Windows DLL), the files will be copied to that directory.

load_command
------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0031``.

Load a command into a running CMake.

::

 load_command(COMMAND_NAME <loc1> [loc2 ...])

The given locations are searched for a library whose name is
cmCOMMAND_NAME.  If found, it is loaded as a module and the command is
added to the set of available CMake commands.  Usually,
``try_compile()`` is used before this command to compile the
module.  If the command is successfully loaded a variable named

::

 CMAKE_LOADED_COMMAND_<COMMAND_NAME>

will be set to the full path of the module that was loaded.  Otherwise
the variable will not be set.

make_directory
--------------

::

 make_directory(directory)

Creates the specified directory.  Full paths should be given.  Any
parent directories that do not exist will also be created.  Use with
care.

output_required_files
---------------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0032``.

Approximate C preprocessor dependency scanning.

This command exists only because ancient CMake versions provided it.
CMake handles preprocessor dependency scanning automatically using a
more advanced scanner.

::

 output_required_files(srcfile outputfile)

Outputs a list of all the source files that are required by the
specified ``srcfile``.  This list is written into ``outputfile``.  This is
similar to writing out the dependencies for ``srcfile`` except that it
jumps from ``.h`` files into ``.cxx``, ``.c`` and ``.cpp`` files if possible.

qt_wrap_cpp
-----------

Manually create Qt Wrappers.

 qt_wrap_cpp(resultingLibraryName DestName SourceLists ...)

Produces moc files for all the .h files listed in the SourceLists.  The
moc files will be added to the library using the ``DestName`` source list.

Consider updating the project to use the ``AUTOMOC`` target property
instead for a more automated way of invoking the ``moc`` tool.

qt_wrap_ui
----------

Manually create Qt user interfaces Wrappers.

 qt_wrap_ui(resultingLibraryName HeadersDestName
            SourcesDestName SourceLists ...)

Produces .h and .cxx files for all the .ui files listed in the
``SourceLists``.  The .h files will be added to the library using the
``HeadersDestNamesource`` list.  The .cxx files will be added to the
library using the ``SourcesDestNamesource`` list.

Consider updating the project to use the ``AUTOUIC`` target property
instead for a more automated way of invoking the ``uic`` tool.

remove
------

::

 remove(VAR VALUE VALUE ...)

Removes ``VALUE`` from the variable ``VAR``.  This is typically used to
remove entries from a vector (e.g.  semicolon separated list).  ``VALUE``
is expanded.

subdir_depends
--------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0029``.

Does nothing.

::

 subdir_depends(subdir dep1 dep2 ...)

Does not do anything.  This command used to help projects order
parallel builds correctly.  This functionality is now automatic.

subdirs
-------

Add a list of subdirectories to the build.

::

 subdirs(dir1 dir2 ...[EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL exclude_dir1 exclude_dir2 ...]
         [PREORDER] )

Add a list of subdirectories to the build.  The ``add_subdirectory()``
command should be used instead of ``subdirs`` although ``subdirs`` will still
work.  This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories
to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the ``PREORDER`` flag are
traversed first by makefile builds, the ``PREORDER`` flag has no effect on
IDE projects.  Any directories after the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` marker will
not be included in the top level makefile or project file.  This is
useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of
examples in a project.  You would want CMake to generate makefiles or
project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not
want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time
make is run from the top.

use_mangled_mesa
----------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0030``.

Copy mesa headers for use in combination with system GL.

::

 use_mangled_mesa(PATH_TO_MESA OUTPUT_DIRECTORY)

The path to mesa includes, should contain ``gl_mangle.h``.  The mesa
headers are copied to the specified output directory.  This allows
mangled mesa headers to override other GL headers by being added to
the include directory path earlier.

utility_source
--------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0034``.

Specify the source tree of a third-party utility.

::

 utility_source(cache_entry executable_name
                path_to_source [file1 file2 ...])

When a third-party utility's source is included in the distribution,
this command specifies its location and name.  The cache entry will
not be set unless the ``path_to_source`` and all listed files exist.  It
is assumed that the source tree of the utility will have been built
before it is needed.

When cross compiling CMake will print a warning if a ``utility_source()``
command is executed, because in many cases it is used to build an
executable which is executed later on.  This doesn't work when cross
compiling, since the executable can run only on their target platform.
So in this case the cache entry has to be adjusted manually so it
points to an executable which is runnable on the build host.

variable_requires
-----------------

Disallowed since version 3.0.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0035``.

Use the ``if()`` command instead.

Assert satisfaction of an option's required variables.

::

 variable_requires(TEST_VARIABLE RESULT_VARIABLE
                   REQUIRED_VARIABLE1
                   REQUIRED_VARIABLE2 ...)

The first argument (``TEST_VARIABLE``) is the name of the variable to be
tested, if that variable is false nothing else is done.  If
``TEST_VARIABLE`` is true, then the next argument (``RESULT_VARIABLE``)
is a variable that is set to true if all the required variables are set.
The rest of the arguments are variables that must be true or not set
to ``NOTFOUND`` to avoid an error.  If any are not true, an error is
reported.

write_file
----------

::

 write_file(filename "message to write"... [APPEND])

The first argument is the file name, the rest of the arguments are
messages to write.  If the argument ``APPEND`` is specified, then the
message will be appended.

NOTE 1: ``file(WRITE)``  and ``file(APPEND)``  do exactly
the same as this one but add some more functionality.

NOTE 2: When using ``write_file`` the produced file cannot be used as an
input to CMake (CONFIGURE_FILE, source file ...) because it will lead
to an infinite loop.  Use ``configure_file()`` if you want to
generate input files to CMake.

cmake-compile-features(7)
*************************

Introduction
============

Project source code may depend on, or be conditional on, the availability
of certain features of the compiler.  There are three use-cases which arise:
Compile Feature Requirements, Optional Compile Features
and Conditional Compilation Options.

While features are typically specified in programming language standards,
CMake provides a primary user interface based on granular handling of
the features, not the language standard that introduced the feature.

The ``CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES`` and
``CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES`` global properties contain all the
features known to CMake, regardless of compiler support for the feature.
The ``CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES`` and
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES`` variables contain all features
CMake knows are known to the compiler, regardless of language standard
or compile flags needed to use them.

Features known to CMake are named mostly following the same convention
as the Clang feature test macros.  The are some exceptions, such as
CMake using ``cxx_final`` and ``cxx_override`` instead of the single
``cxx_override_control`` used by Clang.

Compile Feature Requirements
============================

Compile feature requirements may be specified with the
``target_compile_features()`` command.  For example, if a target must
be compiled with compiler support for the
``cxx_constexpr`` feature:

 add_library(mylib requires_constexpr.cpp)
 target_compile_features(mylib PRIVATE cxx_constexpr)

In processing the requirement for the ``cxx_constexpr`` feature,
``cmake(1)`` will ensure that the in-use C++ compiler is capable
of the feature, and will add any necessary flags such as ``-std=gnu++11``
to the compile lines of C++ files in the ``mylib`` target.  A
``FATAL_ERROR`` is issued if the compiler is not capable of the
feature.

The exact compile flags and language standard are deliberately not part
of the user interface for this use-case.  CMake will compute the
appropriate compile flags to use by considering the features specified
for each target.

Such compile flags are added even if the compiler supports the
particular feature without the flag. For example, the GNU compiler
supports variadic templates (with a warning) even if ``-std=gnu++98`` is
used.  CMake adds the ``-std=gnu++11`` flag if ``cxx_variadic_templates``
is specified as a requirement.

In the above example, ``mylib`` requires ``cxx_constexpr`` when it
is built itself, but consumers of ``mylib`` are not required to use a
compiler which supports ``cxx_constexpr``.  If the interface of
``mylib`` does require the ``cxx_constexpr`` feature (or any other
known feature), that may be specified with the ``PUBLIC`` or
``INTERFACE`` signatures of ``target_compile_features()``:

 add_library(mylib requires_constexpr.cpp)
 # cxx_constexpr is a usage-requirement
 target_compile_features(mylib PUBLIC cxx_constexpr)

 # main.cpp will be compiled with -std=gnu++11 on GNU for cxx_constexpr.
 add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(myexe mylib)

Feature requirements are evaluated transitively by consuming the link
implementation.  See ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` for more on
transitive behavior of build properties and usage requirements.

Requiring Language Standards
----------------------------

In projects that use a large number of commonly available features from
a particular language standard (e.g. C++ 11) one may specify a
meta-feature (e.g. ``cxx_std_11``) that requires use of a compiler mode
aware of that standard.  This is simpler than specifying all the
features individually, but does not guarantee the existence of any
particular feature.  Diagnosis of use of unsupported features will be
delayed until compile time.

For example, if C++ 11 features are used extensively in a project's
header files, then clients must use a compiler mode aware of C++ 11
or above.  This can be requested with the code:

 target_compile_features(mylib PUBLIC cxx_std_11)

In this example, CMake will ensure the compiler is invoked in a mode
that is aware of C++ 11 (or above), adding flags such as
``-std=gnu++11`` if necessary.  This applies to sources within ``mylib``
as well as any dependents (that may include headers from ``mylib``).

Availability of Compiler Extensions
-----------------------------------

Because the ``CXX_EXTENSIONS`` target property is ``ON`` by default,
CMake uses extended variants of language dialects by default, such as
``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11``.  That target property may be
set to ``OFF`` to use the non-extended variant of the dialect flag.  Note
that because most compilers enable extensions by default, this could
expose cross-platform bugs in user code or in the headers of third-party
dependencies.

Optional Compile Features
=========================

Compile features may be preferred if available, without creating a hard
requirement.  For example, a library may provides alternative
implementations depending on whether the ``cxx_variadic_templates``
feature is available:

 #if Foo_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
 template<int I, int... Is>
 struct Interface;

 template<int I>
 struct Interface<I>
 {
   static int accumulate()
   {
     return I;
   }
 };

 template<int I, int... Is>
 struct Interface
 {
   static int accumulate()
   {
     return I + Interface<Is...>::accumulate();
   }
 };
 #else
 template<int I1, int I2 = 0, int I3 = 0, int I4 = 0>
 struct Interface
 {
   static int accumulate() { return I1 + I2 + I3 + I4; }
 };
 #endif

Such an interface depends on using the correct preprocessor defines for the
compiler features.  CMake can generate a header file containing such
defines using the ``WriteCompilerDetectionHeader`` module.  The
module contains the ``write_compiler_detection_header`` function which
accepts parameters to control the content of the generated header file:

 write_compiler_detection_header(
   FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/foo_compiler_detection.h"
   PREFIX Foo
   COMPILERS GNU
   FEATURES
     cxx_variadic_templates
 )

Such a header file may be used internally in the source code of a project,
and it may be installed and used in the interface of library code.

For each feature listed in ``FEATURES``, a preprocessor definition
is created in the header file, and defined to either ``1`` or ``0``.

Additionally, some features call for additional defines, such as the
``cxx_final`` and ``cxx_override`` features. Rather than being used in
``#ifdef`` code, the ``final`` keyword is abstracted by a symbol
which is defined to either ``final``, a compiler-specific equivalent, or
to empty.  That way, C++ code can be written to unconditionally use the
symbol, and compiler support determines what it is expanded to:

 struct Interface {
   virtual void Execute() = 0;
 };

 struct Concrete Foo_FINAL {
   void Execute() Foo_OVERRIDE;
 };

In this case, ``Foo_FINAL`` will expand to ``final`` if the
compiler supports the keyword, or to empty otherwise.

In this use-case, the CMake code will wish to enable a particular language
standard if available from the compiler. The ``CXX_STANDARD``
target property variable may be set to the desired language standard
for a particular target, and the ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`` may be
set to influence all following targets:

 write_compiler_detection_header(
   FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/foo_compiler_detection.h"
   PREFIX Foo
   COMPILERS GNU
   FEATURES
     cxx_final cxx_override
 )

 # Includes foo_compiler_detection.h and uses the Foo_FINAL symbol
 # which will expand to 'final' if the compiler supports the requested
 # CXX_STANDARD.
 add_library(foo foo.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

 # Includes foo_compiler_detection.h and uses the Foo_FINAL symbol
 # which will expand to 'final' if the compiler supports the feature,
 # even though CXX_STANDARD is not set explicitly.  The requirement of
 # cxx_constexpr causes CMake to set CXX_STANDARD internally, which
 # affects the compile flags.
 add_library(foo_impl foo_impl.cpp)
 target_compile_features(foo_impl PRIVATE cxx_constexpr)

The ``write_compiler_detection_header`` function also creates compatibility
code for other features which have standard equivalents.  For example, the
``cxx_static_assert`` feature is emulated with a template and abstracted
via the ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT`` and ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG``
function-macros.

Conditional Compilation Options
===============================

Libraries may provide entirely different header files depending on
requested compiler features.

For example, a header at ``with_variadics/interface.h`` may contain:

 template<int I, int... Is>
 struct Interface;

 template<int I>
 struct Interface<I>
 {
   static int accumulate()
   {
     return I;
   }
 };

 template<int I, int... Is>
 struct Interface
 {
   static int accumulate()
   {
     return I + Interface<Is...>::accumulate();
   }
 };

while a header at ``no_variadics/interface.h`` may contain:

 template<int I1, int I2 = 0, int I3 = 0, int I4 = 0>
 struct Interface
 {
   static int accumulate() { return I1 + I2 + I3 + I4; }
 };

It would be possible to write a abstraction ``interface.h`` header
containing something like:

 #include "foo_compiler_detection.h"
 #if Foo_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
 #include "with_variadics/interface.h"
 #else
 #include "no_variadics/interface.h"
 #endif

However this could be unmaintainable if there are many files to
abstract. What is needed is to use alternative include directories
depending on the compiler capabilities.

CMake provides a ``COMPILE_FEATURES``
``generator expression`` to implement
such conditions.  This may be used with the build-property commands such as
``target_include_directories()`` and ``target_link_libraries()``
to set the appropriate ``buildsystem``
properties:

 add_library(foo INTERFACE)
 set(with_variadics ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/with_variadics)
 set(no_variadics ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/no_variadics)
 target_include_directories(foo
   INTERFACE
     "$<$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_variadic_templates>:${with_variadics}>"
     "$<$<NOT:$<COMPILE_FEATURES:cxx_variadic_templates>>:${no_variadics}>"
   )

Consuming code then simply links to the ``foo`` target as usual and uses
the feature-appropriate include directory

 add_executable(consumer_with consumer_with.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(consumer_with foo)
 set_property(TARGET consumer_with CXX_STANDARD 11)

 add_executable(consumer_no consumer_no.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(consumer_no foo)

* ``TI``: Texas Instruments compiler.

CMake is currently aware of the ``CUDA standards``
from the following ``compiler ids`` as of the
versions specified for each:

* ``NVIDIA``: NVIDIA nvcc compiler 7.5 though 9.1.

Introduction
============

This manual is intended for reference by developers working with
``cmake-language(7)`` code, whether writing their own modules,
authoring their own build systems, or working on CMake itself.

See https://cmake.org/get-involved/ to get involved in development of
CMake upstream.  It includes links to contribution instructions, which
in turn link to developer guides for CMake itself.

Find Modules
============

A "find module" is a ``Find<PackageName>.cmake`` file to be loaded
by the ``find_package()`` command when invoked for ``<PackageName>``.

The primary task of a find module is to determine whether a package
exists on the system, set the ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable to reflect
this and provide any variables, macros and imported targets required to
use the package.  A find module is useful in cases where an upstream
library does not provide a
:ref:`config file package <Config File Packages>`.

The traditional approach is to use variables for everything, including
libraries and executables: see the Standard Variable Names section
below.  This is what most of the existing find modules provided by CMake
do.

The more modern approach is to behave as much like
:ref:`config file packages <Config File Packages>` files as possible, by
providing :ref:`imported target <Imported targets>`.  This has the advantage
of propagating :ref:`Target Usage Requirements` to consumers.

In either case (or even when providing both variables and imported
targets), find modules should provide backwards compatibility with old
versions that had the same name.

A FindFoo.cmake module will typically be loaded by the command::

 find_package(Foo [major[.minor[.patch[.tweak]]]]
              [EXACT] [QUIET] [REQUIRED]
              [[COMPONENTS] [components...]]
              [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS components...]
              [NO_POLICY_SCOPE])

See the ``find_package()`` documentation for details on what
variables are set for the find module.  Most of these are dealt with by
using ``FindPackageHandleStandardArgs``.

Briefly, the module should only locate versions of the package
compatible with the requested version, as described by the
``Foo_FIND_VERSION`` family of variables.  If ``Foo_FIND_QUIETLY`` is
set to true, it should avoid printing messages, including anything
complaining about the package not being found.  If ``Foo_FIND_REQUIRED``
is set to true, the module should issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if the package
cannot be found.  If neither are set to true, it should print a
non-fatal message if it cannot find the package.

Packages that find multiple semi-independent parts (like bundles of
libraries) should search for the components listed in
``Foo_FIND_COMPONENTS`` if it is set , and only set ``Foo_FOUND`` to
true if for each searched-for component ``<c>`` that was not found,
``Foo_FIND_REQUIRED_<c>`` is not set to true.  The ``HANDLE_COMPONENTS``
argument of ``find_package_handle_standard_args()`` can be used to
implement this.

If ``Foo_FIND_COMPONENTS`` is not set, which modules are searched for
and required is up to the find module, but should be documented.

For internal implementation, it is a generally accepted convention that
variables starting with underscore are for temporary use only.


Standard Variable Names
-----------------------

For a ``FindXxx.cmake`` module that takes the approach of setting
variables (either instead of or in addition to creating imported
targets), the following variable names should be used to keep things
consistent between find modules.  Note that all variables start with
``Xxx_`` to make sure they do not interfere with other find modules; the
same consideration applies to macros, functions and imported targets.

``Xxx_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  The final set of include directories listed in one variable for use by
  client code.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_LIBRARIES``
  The libraries to link against to use Xxx. These should include full
  paths.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_DEFINITIONS``
  Definitions to use when compiling code that uses Xxx. This really
  shouldn't include options such as ``-DHAS_JPEG`` that a client
  source-code file uses to decide whether to ``#include <jpeg.h>``

``Xxx_EXECUTABLE``
  Where to find the Xxx tool.

``Xxx_Yyy_EXECUTABLE``
  Where to find the Yyy tool that comes with Xxx.

``Xxx_LIBRARY_DIRS``
  Optionally, the final set of library directories listed in one
  variable for use by client code.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_ROOT_DIR``
  Where to find the base directory of Xxx.

``Xxx_VERSION_Yy``
  Expect Version Yy if true. Make sure at most one of these is ever true.

``Xxx_WRAP_Yy``
  If False, do not try to use the relevant CMake wrapping command.

``Xxx_Yy_FOUND``
  If False, optional Yy part of Xxx system is not available.

``Xxx_FOUND``
  Set to false, or undefined, if we haven't found, or don't want to use
  Xxx.

``Xxx_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE``
  Should be set by config-files in the case that it has set
  ``Xxx_FOUND`` to FALSE.  The contained message will be printed by the
  ``find_package()`` command and by
  ``find_package_handle_standard_args()`` to inform the user about the
  problem.

``Xxx_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS``
  Optionally, the runtime library search path for use when running an
  executable linked to shared libraries.  The list should be used by
  user code to create the ``PATH`` on windows or ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` on
  UNIX.  This should not be a cache entry.

``Xxx_VERSION``
  The full version string of the package found, if any.  Note that many
  existing modules provide ``Xxx_VERSION_STRING`` instead.

``Xxx_VERSION_MAJOR``
  The major version of the package found, if any.

``Xxx_VERSION_MINOR``
  The minor version of the package found, if any.

``Xxx_VERSION_PATCH``
  The patch version of the package found, if any.

The following names should not usually be used in CMakeLists.txt files, but
are typically cache variables for users to edit and control the
behaviour of find modules (like entering the path to a library manually)

``Xxx_LIBRARY``
  The path of the Xxx library (as used with ``find_library()``, for
  example).

``Xxx_Yy_LIBRARY``
  The path of the Yy library that is part of the Xxx system. It may or
  may not be required to use Xxx.

``Xxx_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Where to find headers for using the Xxx library.

``Xxx_Yy_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Where to find headers for using the Yy library of the Xxx system.

To prevent users being overwhelmed with settings to configure, try to
keep as many options as possible out of the cache, leaving at least one
option which can be used to disable use of the module, or locate a
not-found library (e.g. ``Xxx_ROOT_DIR``).  For the same reason, mark
most cache options as advanced.  For packages which provide both debug
and release binaries, it is common to create cache variables with a
``_LIBRARY_<CONFIG>`` suffix, such as ``Foo_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` and
``Foo_LIBRARY_DEBUG``.

While these are the standard variable names, you should provide
backwards compatibility for any old names that were actually in use.
Make sure you comment them as deprecated, so that no-one starts using
them.


A Sample Find Module
--------------------

We will describe how to create a simple find module for a library ``Foo``.

The top of the module should begin with a license notice, followed by
a blank line, and then followed by a :ref:`Bracket Comment`.  The comment
should begin with ``.rst:`` to indicate that the rest of its content is
reStructuredText-format documentation.  For example:

::

 # Distributed under the OSI-approved BSD 3-Clause License.  See accompanying
 # file Copyright.txt or https://cmake.org/licensing for details.

 #[=======================================================================[.rst:
 FindFoo
 -------

 Finds the Foo library.

 Imported Targets
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 This module provides the following imported targets, if found:

 ``Foo::Foo``
   The Foo library

 Result Variables
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 This will define the following variables:

 ``Foo_FOUND``
   True if the system has the Foo library.
 ``Foo_VERSION``
   The version of the Foo library which was found.
 ``Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS``
   Include directories needed to use Foo.
 ``Foo_LIBRARIES``
   Libraries needed to link to Foo.

 Cache Variables
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 The following cache variables may also be set:

 ``Foo_INCLUDE_DIR``
   The directory containing ``foo.h``.
 ``Foo_LIBRARY``
   The path to the Foo library.

 #]=======================================================================]

The module documentation consists of:

* An underlined heading specifying the module name.

* A simple description of what the module finds.
  More description may be required for some packages.  If there are
  caveats or other details users of the module should be aware of,
  specify them here.

* A section listing imported targets provided by the module, if any.

* A section listing result variables provided by the module.

* Optionally a section listing cache variables used by the module, if any.

If the package provides any macros or functions, they should be listed in
an additional section, but can be documented by additional ``.rst:``
comment blocks immediately above where those macros or functions are defined.

The find module implementation may begin below the documentation block.
Now the actual libraries and so on have to be found.  The code here will
obviously vary from module to module (dealing with that, after all, is the
point of find modules), but there tends to be a common pattern for libraries.

First, we try to use ``pkg-config`` to find the library.  Note that we
cannot rely on this, as it may not be available, but it provides a good
starting point.

 find_package(PkgConfig)
 pkg_check_modules(PC_Foo QUIET Foo)

This should define some variables starting ``PC_Foo_`` that contain the
information from the ``Foo.pc`` file.

Now we need to find the libraries and include files; we use the
information from ``pkg-config`` to provide hints to CMake about where to
look.

 find_path(Foo_INCLUDE_DIR
   NAMES foo.h
   PATHS ${PC_Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS}
   PATH_SUFFIXES Foo
 )
 find_library(Foo_LIBRARY
   NAMES foo
   PATHS ${PC_Foo_LIBRARY_DIRS}
 )

If you have a good way of getting the version (from a header file, for
example), you can use that information to set ``Foo_VERSION`` (although
note that find modules have traditionally used ``Foo_VERSION_STRING``,
so you may want to set both).  Otherwise, attempt to use the information
from ``pkg-config``

 set(Foo_VERSION ${PC_Foo_VERSION})

Now we can use ``FindPackageHandleStandardArgs`` to do most of the
rest of the work for us

 include(FindPackageHandleStandardArgs)
 find_package_handle_standard_args(Foo
   FOUND_VAR Foo_FOUND
   REQUIRED_VARS
     Foo_LIBRARY
     Foo_INCLUDE_DIR
   VERSION_VAR Foo_VERSION
 )

This will check that the ``REQUIRED_VARS`` contain values (that do not
end in ``-NOTFOUND``) and set ``Foo_FOUND`` appropriately.  It will also
cache those values.  If ``Foo_VERSION`` is set, and a required version
was passed to ``find_package()``, it will check the requested version
against the one in ``Foo_VERSION``.  It will also print messages as
appropriate; note that if the package was found, it will print the
contents of the first required variable to indicate where it was found.

At this point, we have to provide a way for users of the find module to
link to the library or libraries that were found.  There are two
approaches, as discussed in the Find Modules section above.  The
traditional variable approach looks like

 if(Foo_FOUND)
   set(Foo_LIBRARIES ${Foo_LIBRARY})
   set(Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS ${Foo_INCLUDE_DIR})
   set(Foo_DEFINITIONS ${PC_Foo_CFLAGS_OTHER})
 endif()

If more than one library was found, all of them should be included in
these variables (see the Standard Variable Names section for more
information).

When providing imported targets, these should be namespaced (hence the
``Foo::`` prefix); CMake will recognize that values passed to
``target_link_libraries()`` that contain ``::`` in their name are
supposed to be imported targets (rather than just library names), and
will produce appropriate diagnostic messages if that target does not
exist (see policy ``CMP0028``).

 if(Foo_FOUND AND NOT TARGET Foo::Foo)
   add_library(Foo::Foo UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
   set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
     IMPORTED_LOCATION "${Foo_LIBRARY}"
     INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS "${PC_Foo_CFLAGS_OTHER}"
     INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${Foo_INCLUDE_DIR}"
   )
 endif()

One thing to note about this is that the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` and
similar properties should only contain information about the target itself, and
not any of its dependencies.  Instead, those dependencies should also be
targets, and CMake should be told that they are dependencies of this target.
CMake will then combine all the necessary information automatically.

The type of the ``IMPORTED`` target created in the
``add_library()`` command can always be specified as ``UNKNOWN``
type.  This simplifies the code in cases where static or shared variants may
be found, and CMake will determine the type by inspecting the files.

If the library is available with multiple configurations, the
``IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS`` target property should also be
populated:

 if(Foo_FOUND)
   if (NOT TARGET Foo::Foo)
     add_library(Foo::Foo UNKNOWN IMPORTED)
   endif()
   if (Foo_LIBRARY_RELEASE)
     set_property(TARGET Foo::Foo APPEND PROPERTY
       IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASE
     )
     set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
       IMPORTED_LOCATION_RELEASE "${Foo_LIBRARY_RELEASE}"
     )
   endif()
   if (Foo_LIBRARY_DEBUG)
     set_property(TARGET Foo::Foo APPEND PROPERTY
       IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG
     )
     set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
       IMPORTED_LOCATION_DEBUG "${Foo_LIBRARY_DEBUG}"
     )
   endif()
   set_target_properties(Foo::Foo PROPERTIES
     INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS "${PC_Foo_CFLAGS_OTHER}"
     INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES "${Foo_INCLUDE_DIR}"
   )
 endif()

The ``RELEASE`` variant should be listed first in the property
so that the variant is chosen if the user uses a configuration which is
not an exact match for any listed ``IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS``.

Most of the cache variables should be hidden in the ``ccmake`` interface unless
the user explicitly asks to edit them.

 mark_as_advanced(
   Foo_INCLUDE_DIR
   Foo_LIBRARY
 )

If this module replaces an older version, you should set compatibility variables
to cause the least disruption possible.

 # compatibility variables
 set(Foo_VERSION_STRING ${Foo_VERSION})

cmake-env-variables(7)
**********************

This page lists environment variables that have special
meaning to CMake.

For general information on environment variables, see the
:ref:`Environment Variables <CMake Language Environment Variables>`
section in the cmake-language manual.


Environment Variables that Control the Build
============================================

CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL
--------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Specifies the maximum number of concurrent processes to use when building
using the ``cmake --build`` command line
:ref:`Build Tool Mode <Build Tool Mode>`.

If this variable is defined empty the native build tool's default number is
used.

CMAKE_CONFIG_TYPE
-----------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

The default build configuration for :ref:`Build Tool Mode` and
``ctest`` build handler when there is no explicit configuration given.

CMAKE_GENERATOR
---------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Specifies the CMake default generator to use when no generator is supplied
with ``-G``. If the provided value doesn't name a generator known by CMake,
the internal default is used.  Either way the resulting generator selection
is stored in the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` variable.

Some generators may be additionally configured using the environment
variables:

* ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``
* ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET``
* ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE``

CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE
------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Default value for ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` if no Cache entry is
present. This value is only applied if ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` is set.

CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM
------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Default value for ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` if no Cache entry
is present and no value is specified by ``cmake(1)`` ``-A`` option.
This value is only applied if ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` is set.

CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET
-----------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Default value for ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` if no Cache entry
is present and no value is specified by ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option.
This value is only applied if ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` is set.

CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH
----------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Extra PATH locations for custom commands when using
``Visual Studio 9 2008`` (or above) generators.

The ``CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH`` environment variable sets the default value for
the ``CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH`` variable if not already explicitly set.

CMAKE_NO_VERBOSE
----------------

Disables verbose output from CMake when ``VERBOSE`` environment variable
is set.

Only your build tool of choice will still print verbose output when you start
to actually build your project.

CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Target specific architectures for macOS.

The ``CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` environment variable sets the default value for
the ``CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` variable. See
``OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` for more information.

DESTDIR
-------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

On UNIX one can use the ``DESTDIR`` mechanism in order to relocate the
whole installation.  ``DESTDIR`` means DESTination DIRectory.  It is
commonly used by makefile users in order to install software at
non-default location.  It is usually invoked like this:

::

 make DESTDIR=/home/john install

which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g.  ``/usr/local`` prepended with the ``DESTDIR`` value which
finally gives ``/home/john/usr/local``.

WARNING: ``DESTDIR`` may not be used on Windows because installation
prefix usually contains a drive letter like in ``C:/Program Files``
which cannot be prepended with some other prefix.

LDFLAGS
-------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine the default
linker flags, after which the value for ``LDFLAGS`` is stored in the cache
as ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``,
``CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``, and
``CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``. For any configuration run
(including the first), the environment variable will be ignored if the
equivalent  ``CMAKE_<TYPE>_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT`` variable is defined.

MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Specify the minimum version of macOS on which the target binaries are
to be deployed.

The ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environment variable sets the default value for
the ``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` variable.

<PackageName>_ROOT
------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Calls to ``find_package(<PackageName>)`` will search in prefixes
specified by the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable, where
``<PackageName>`` is the name given to the ``find_package()`` call
and ``_ROOT`` is literal.  For example, ``find_package(Foo)`` will search
prefixes specified in the ``Foo_ROOT`` environment variable (if set).
See policy ``CMP0074``.

This variable may hold a single prefix or a list of prefixes separated
by ``:`` on UNIX or ``;`` on Windows (the same as the ``PATH`` environment
variable convention on those platforms).

See also the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake variable.

VERBOSE
-------

Activates verbose output from CMake and your build tools of choice when
you start to actually build your project.

Note that any given value is ignored. It's just checked for existence.

See also :ref:`Build Tool Mode <Build Tool Mode>` and
``CMAKE_NO_VERBOSE`` environment variable

Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine
``ASM<DIALECT>`` compiler, after which the value for ``ASM<DIALECT>`` is stored
in the cache as
``CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_COMPILER``. For subsequent
configuration runs, the environment variable will be ignored in favor of
``CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_COMPILER``.

-----------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

``ASM_MASMFLAGS`` or ``ASM-ATTFLAGS``. Will only be used by CMake on the
first configuration to determine ``ASM_<DIALECT>`` default compilation
flags, after which the value for ``ASM<DIALECT>FLAGS`` is stored in the cache
as ``CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>``.  For any configuration
run (including the first), the environment variable will be ignored, if the
``CMAKE_ASM<DIALECT>_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>`` variable is defined.

Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

The default build configuration for :ref:`Build Tool Mode` and
``ctest`` build handler when there is no explicit configuration given.

CTEST_INTERACTIVE_DEBUG_MODE
----------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Environment variable that will exist and be set to ``1`` when a test executed
by ``ctest(1)`` is run in interactive mode.

CTEST_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE
-----------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Boolean environment variable that controls if the output should be logged for
failed tests. Set the value to ``1``, ``True``, or ``ON`` to enable output on failure.
See ``ctest(1)`` for more information on controlling output of failed
tests.

CTEST_PARALLEL_LEVEL
--------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Specify the number of tests for CTest to run in parallel. See ``ctest(1)``
for more information on parallel test execution.

CTEST_PROGRESS_OUTPUT
---------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Boolean environment variable that affects how ``ctest``
command output reports overall progress.  When set to ``1``, ``TRUE``, ``ON`` or anything
else that evaluates to boolean true, progress is reported by repeatedly
updating the same line.  This greatly reduces the overall verbosity, but is
only supported when output is sent directly to a terminal.  If the environment
variable is not set or has a value that evaluates to false, output is reported
normally with each test having its own start and end lines logged to the
output.

The ``--progress`` option to ``ctest`` overrides this
environment variable if both are given.

CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT
---------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Initializes the ``CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS`` variable if not already defined.

DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST
-------------------------

This is a CMake :ref:`Environment Variable <CMake Language
Environment Variables>`. Its initial value is taken from
the calling process environment.

Environment variable that will exist when a test executed by ``ctest(1)``
is run in non-interactive mode.  The value will be equal to
``CMAKE_VERSION``.

Introduction
============

CMake provides a file-based API that clients may use to get semantic
information about the buildsystems CMake generates.  Clients may use
the API by writing query files to a specific location in a build tree
to request zero or more Object Kinds.  When CMake generates the
buildsystem in that build tree it will read the query files and write
reply files for the client to read.

The file-based API uses a ``<build>/.cmake/api/`` directory at the top
of a build tree.  The API is versioned to support changes to the layout
of files within the API directory.  API file layout versioning is
orthogonal to the versioning of Object Kinds used in replies.
This version of CMake supports only one API version, API v1.

API v1
======

API v1 is housed in the ``<build>/.cmake/api/v1/`` directory.
It has the following subdirectories:

``query/``
  Holds query files written by clients.
  These may be v1 Shared Stateless Query Files,
  v1 Client Stateless Query Files, or v1 Client Stateful Query Files.

``reply/``
  Holds reply files written by CMake whenever it runs to generate a build
  system.  These are indexed by a v1 Reply Index File file that may
  reference additional v1 Reply Files.  CMake owns all reply files.
  Clients must never remove them.

  Clients may look for and read a reply index file at any time.
  Clients may optionally create the ``reply/`` directory at any time
  and monitor it for the appearance of a new reply index file.

v1 Shared Stateless Query Files
-------------------------------

Shared stateless query files allow clients to share requests for
major versions of the Object Kinds and get all requested versions
recognized by the CMake that runs.

Clients may create shared requests by creating empty files in the
``v1/query/`` directory.  The form is::

 <build>/.cmake/api/v1/query/<kind>-v<major>

where ``<kind>`` is one of the Object Kinds, ``-v`` is literal,
and ``<major>`` is the major version number.

Files of this form are stateless shared queries not owned by any specific
client.  Once created they should not be removed without external client
coordination or human intervention.

v1 Client Stateless Query Files
-------------------------------

Client stateless query files allow clients to create owned requests for
major versions of the Object Kinds and get all requested versions
recognized by the CMake that runs.

Clients may create owned requests by creating empty files in
client-specific query subdirectories.  The form is::

 <build>/.cmake/api/v1/query/client-<client>/<kind>-v<major>

where ``client-`` is literal, ``<client>`` is a string uniquely
identifying the client, ``<kind>`` is one of the Object Kinds,
``-v`` is literal, and ``<major>`` is the major version number.
Each client must choose a unique ``<client>`` identifier via its
own means.

Files of this form are stateless queries owned by the client ``<client>``.
The owning client may remove them at any time.

v1 Client Stateful Query Files
------------------------------

Stateful query files allow clients to request a list of versions of
each of the Object Kinds and get only the most recent version
recognized by the CMake that runs.

Clients may create owned stateful queries by creating ``query.json``
files in client-specific query subdirectories.  The form is::

 <build>/.cmake/api/v1/query/client-<client>/query.json

where ``client-`` is literal, ``<client>`` is a string uniquely
identifying the client, and ``query.json`` is literal.  Each client
must choose a unique ``<client>`` identifier via its own means.

``query.json`` files are stateful queries owned by the client ``<client>``.
The owning client may update or remove them at any time.  When a
given client installation is updated it may then update the stateful
query it writes to build trees to request newer object versions.
This can be used to avoid asking CMake to generate multiple object
versions unnecessarily.

A ``query.json`` file must contain a JSON object:

 {
   "requests": [
     { "kind": "<kind>" , "version": 1 },
     { "kind": "<kind>" , "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 2 } },
     { "kind": "<kind>" , "version": [2, 1] },
     { "kind": "<kind>" , "version": [2, { "major": 1, "minor": 2 }] },
     { "kind": "<kind>" , "version": 1, "client": {} },
     { "kind": "..." }
   ],
   "client": {}
 }

The members are:

``requests``
  A JSON array containing zero or more requests.  Each request is
  a JSON object with members:

  ``kind``
    Specifies one of the Object Kinds to be included in the reply.

  ``version``
    Indicates the version(s) of the object kind that the client
    understands.  Versions have major and minor components following
    semantic version conventions.  The value must be

    * a JSON integer specifying a (non-negative) major version number, or
    * a JSON object containing ``major`` and (optionally) ``minor``
      members specifying non-negative integer version components, or
    * a JSON array whose elements are each one of the above.

  ``client``
    Optional member reserved for use by the client.  This value is
    preserved in the reply written for the client in the
    v1 Reply Index File but is otherwise ignored.  Clients may use
    this to pass custom information with a request through to its reply.

  For each requested object kind CMake will choose the *first* version
  that it recognizes for that kind among those listed in the request.
  The response will use the selected *major* version with the highest
  *minor* version known to the running CMake for that major version.
  Therefore clients should list all supported major versions in
  preferred order along with the minimal minor version required
  for each major version.

``client``
  Optional member reserved for use by the client.  This value is
  preserved in the reply written for the client in the
  v1 Reply Index File but is otherwise ignored.  Clients may use
  this to pass custom information with a query through to its reply.

Other ``query.json`` top-level members are reserved for future use.
If present they are ignored for forward compatibility.

v1 Reply Index File
-------------------

CMake writes an ``index-*.json`` file to the ``v1/reply/`` directory
whenever it runs to generate a build system.  Clients must read the
reply index file first and may read other v1 Reply Files only by
following references.  The form of the reply index file name is::

 <build>/.cmake/api/v1/reply/index-<unspecified>.json

where ``index-`` is literal and ``<unspecified>`` is an unspecified
name selected by CMake.  Whenever a new index file is generated it
is given a new name and any old one is deleted.  During the short
time between these steps there may be multiple index files present;
the one with the largest name in lexicographic order is the current
index file.

The reply index file contains a JSON object:

 {
   "cmake": {
     "version": {
       "major": 3, "minor": 14, "patch": 0, "suffix": "",
       "string": "3.14.0", "isDirty": false
     },
     "paths": {
       "cmake": "/prefix/bin/cmake",
       "ctest": "/prefix/bin/ctest",
       "cpack": "/prefix/bin/cpack",
       "root": "/prefix/share/cmake-3.14"
     },
     "generator": {
       "name": "Unix Makefiles"
     }
   },
   "objects": [
     { "kind": "<kind>",
       "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
       "jsonFile": "<file>" },
     { "...": "..." }
   ],
   "reply": {
     "<kind>-v<major>": { "kind": "<kind>",
                          "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
                          "jsonFile": "<file>" },
     "<unknown>": { "error": "unknown query file" },
     "...": {},
     "client-<client>": {
       "<kind>-v<major>": { "kind": "<kind>",
                            "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
                            "jsonFile": "<file>" },
       "<unknown>": { "error": "unknown query file" },
       "...": {},
       "query.json": {
         "requests": [ {}, {}, {} ],
         "responses": [
           { "kind": "<kind>",
             "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
             "jsonFile": "<file>" },
           { "error": "unknown query file" },
           { "...": {} }
         ],
         "client": {}
       }
     }
   }
 }

The members are:

``cmake``
  A JSON object containing information about the instance of CMake that
  generated the reply.  It contains members:

  ``version``
    A JSON object specifying the version of CMake with members:

    ``major``, ``minor``, ``patch``
      Integer values specifying the major, minor, and patch version components.
    ``suffix``
      A string specifying the version suffix, if any, e.g. ``g0abc3``.
    ``string``
      A string specifying the full version in the format
      ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>[-<suffix>]``.
    ``isDirty``
      A boolean indicating whether the version was built from a version
      controlled source tree with local modifications.

  ``paths``
    A JSON object specifying paths to things that come with CMake.
    It has members for ``cmake``, ``ctest``, and ``cpack`` whose values
    are JSON strings specifying the absolute path to each tool,
    represented with forward slashes.  It also has a ``root`` member for
    the absolute path to the directory containing CMake resources like the
    ``Modules/`` directory (see ``CMAKE_ROOT``).

  ``generator``
    A JSON object describing the CMake generator used for the build.
    It has members:

    ``name``
      A string specifying the name of the generator.
    ``platform``
      If the generator supports ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``,
      this is a string specifying the generator platform name.

``objects``
  A JSON array listing all versions of all Object Kinds generated
  as part of the reply.  Each array entry is a
  v1 Reply File Reference.

``reply``
  A JSON object mirroring the content of the ``query/`` directory
  that CMake loaded to produce the reply.  The members are of the form

  ``<kind>-v<major>``
    A member of this form appears for each of the
    v1 Shared Stateless Query Files that CMake recognized as a
    request for object kind ``<kind>`` with major version ``<major>``.
    The value is a v1 Reply File Reference to the corresponding
    reply file for that object kind and version.

  ``<unknown>``
    A member of this form appears for each of the
    v1 Shared Stateless Query Files that CMake did not recognize.
    The value is a JSON object with a single ``error`` member
    containing a string with an error message indicating that the
    query file is unknown.

  ``client-<client>``
    A member of this form appears for each client-owned directory
    holding v1 Client Stateless Query Files.
    The value is a JSON object mirroring the content of the
    ``query/client-<client>/`` directory.  The members are of the form:

    ``<kind>-v<major>``
      A member of this form appears for each of the
      v1 Client Stateless Query Files that CMake recognized as a
      request for object kind ``<kind>`` with major version ``<major>``.
      The value is a v1 Reply File Reference to the corresponding
      reply file for that object kind and version.

    ``<unknown>``
      A member of this form appears for each of the
      v1 Client Stateless Query Files that CMake did not recognize.
      The value is a JSON object with a single ``error`` member
      containing a string with an error message indicating that the
      query file is unknown.

    ``query.json``
      This member appears for clients using
      v1 Client Stateful Query Files.
      If the ``query.json`` file failed to read or parse as a JSON object,
      this member is a JSON object with a single ``error`` member
      containing a string with an error message.  Otherwise, this member
      is a JSON object mirroring the content of the ``query.json`` file.
      The members are:

      ``client``
        A copy of the ``query.json`` file ``client`` member, if it exists.

      ``requests``
        A copy of the ``query.json`` file ``requests`` member, if it exists.

      ``responses``
        If the ``query.json`` file ``requests`` member is missing or invalid,
        this member is a JSON object with a single ``error`` member
        containing a string with an error message.  Otherwise, this member
        contains a JSON array with a response for each entry of the
        ``requests`` array, in the same order.  Each response is

        * a JSON object with a single ``error`` member containing a string
          with an error message, or
        * a v1 Reply File Reference to the corresponding reply file for
          the requested object kind and selected version.

After reading the reply index file, clients may read the other
v1 Reply Files it references.

v1 Reply File Reference
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The reply index file represents each reference to another reply file
using a JSON object with members:

``kind``
  A string specifying one of the Object Kinds.
``version``
  A JSON object with members ``major`` and ``minor`` specifying
  integer version components of the object kind.
``jsonFile``
  A JSON string specifying a path relative to the reply index file
  to another JSON file containing the object.

v1 Reply Files
--------------

Reply files containing specific Object Kinds are written by CMake.
The names of these files are unspecified and must not be interpreted
by clients.  Clients must first read the v1 Reply Index File and
and follow references to the names of the desired response objects.

Reply files (including the index file) will never be replaced by
files of the same name but different content.  This allows a client
to read the files concurrently with a running CMake that may generate
a new reply.  However, after generating a new reply CMake will attempt
to remove reply files from previous runs that it did not just write.
If a client attempts to read a reply file referenced by the index but
finds the file missing, that means a concurrent CMake has generated
a new reply.  The client may simply start again by reading the new
reply index file.

Object Kinds
============

The CMake file-based API reports semantic information about the build
system using the following kinds of JSON objects.  Each kind of object
is versioned independently using semantic versioning with major and
minor components.  Every kind of object has the form:

 {
   "kind": "<kind>",
   "version": { "major": 1, "minor": 0 },
   "...": {}
 }

The ``kind`` member is a string specifying the object kind name.
The ``version`` member is a JSON object with ``major`` and ``minor``
members specifying integer components of the object kind's version.
Additional top-level members are specific to each object kind.

Object Kind "codemodel"
-----------------------

The ``codemodel`` object kind describes the build system structure as
modeled by CMake.

There is only one ``codemodel`` object major version, version 2.
Version 1 does not exist to avoid confusion with that from
``cmake-server(7)`` mode.

"codemodel" version 2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``codemodel`` object version 2 is a JSON object:

 {
   "kind": "codemodel",
   "version": { "major": 2, "minor": 0 },
   "paths": {
     "source": "/path/to/top-level-source-dir",
     "build": "/path/to/top-level-build-dir"
   },
   "configurations": [
     {
       "name": "Debug",
       "directories": [
         {
           "source": ".",
           "build": ".",
           "childIndexes": [ 1 ],
           "projectIndex": 0,
           "targetIndexes": [ 0 ],
           "hasInstallRule": true,
           "minimumCMakeVersion": {
             "string": "3.14"
           }
         },
         {
           "source": "sub",
           "build": "sub",
           "parentIndex": 0,
           "projectIndex": 0,
           "targetIndexes": [ 1 ],
           "minimumCMakeVersion": {
             "string": "3.14"
           }
         }
       ],
       "projects": [
         {
           "name": "MyProject",
           "directoryIndexes": [ 0, 1 ],
           "targetIndexes": [ 0, 1 ]
         }
       ],
       "targets": [
         {
           "name": "MyExecutable",
           "directoryIndex": 0,
           "projectIndex": 0,
           "jsonFile": "<file>"
         },
         {
           "name": "MyLibrary",
           "directoryIndex": 1,
           "projectIndex": 0,
           "jsonFile": "<file>"
         }
       ]
     }
   ]
 }

The members specific to ``codemodel`` objects are:

``paths``
  A JSON object containing members:

  ``source``
    A string specifying the absolute path to the top-level source directory,
    represented with forward slashes.

  ``build``
    A string specifying the absolute path to the top-level build directory,
    represented with forward slashes.

``configurations``
  A JSON array of entries corresponding to available build configurations.
  On single-configuration generators there is one entry for the value
  of the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` variable.  For multi-configuration
  generators there is an entry for each configuration listed in the
  ``CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`` variable.
  Each entry is a JSON object containing members:

  ``name``
    A string specifying the name of the configuration, e.g. ``Debug``.

  ``directories``
    A JSON array of entries each corresponding to a build system directory
    whose source directory contains a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file.  The first
    entry corresponds to the top-level directory.  Each entry is a
    JSON object containing members:

    ``source``
      A string specifying the path to the source directory, represented
      with forward slashes.  If the directory is inside the top-level
      source directory then the path is specified relative to that
      directory (with ``.`` for the top-level source directory itself).
      Otherwise the path is absolute.

    ``build``
      A string specifying the path to the build directory, represented
      with forward slashes.  If the directory is inside the top-level
      build directory then the path is specified relative to that
      directory (with ``.`` for the top-level build directory itself).
      Otherwise the path is absolute.

    ``parentIndex``
      Optional member that is present when the directory is not top-level.
      The value is an unsigned integer 0-based index of another entry in
      the main ``directories`` array that corresponds to the parent
      directory that added this directory as a subdirectory.

    ``childIndexes``
      Optional member that is present when the directory has subdirectories.
      The value is a JSON array of entries corresponding to child directories
      created by the ``add_subdirectory()`` or ``subdirs()``
      command.  Each entry is an unsigned integer 0-based index of another
      entry in the main ``directories`` array.

    ``projectIndex``
      An unsigned integer 0-based index into the main ``projects`` array
      indicating the build system project to which the this directory belongs.

    ``targetIndexes``
      Optional member that is present when the directory itself has targets,
      excluding those belonging to subdirectories.  The value is a JSON
      array of entries corresponding to the targets.  Each entry is an
      unsigned integer 0-based index into the main ``targets`` array.

    ``minimumCMakeVersion``
      Optional member present when a minimum required version of CMake is
      known for the directory.  This is the ``<min>`` version given to the
      most local call to the ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)``
      command in the directory itself or one of its ancestors.
      The value is a JSON object with one member:

      ``string``
        A string specifying the minimum required version in the format::

         <major>.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]][<suffix>]

       Each component is an unsigned integer and the suffix may be an
       arbitrary string.

   ``hasInstallRule``
     Optional member that is present with boolean value ``true`` when
     the directory or one of its subdirectories contains any
     :command:`install` rules, i.e. whether a ``make install``
     or equivalent rule is available.

 ``projects``
   A JSON array of entries corresponding to the top-level project
   and sub-projects defined in the build system.  Each (sub-)project
   corresponds to a source directory whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` file
   calls the :command:`project` command with a project name different
   from its parent directory.  The first entry corresponds to the
   top-level project.

   Each entry is a JSON object containing members:

   ``name``
     A string specifying the name given to the :command:`project` command.

   ``parentIndex``
     Optional member that is present when the project is not top-level.
     The value is an unsigned integer 0-based index of another entry in
     the main ``projects`` array that corresponds to the parent project
     that added this project as a sub-project.

   ``childIndexes``
     Optional member that is present when the project has sub-projects.
     The value is a JSON array of entries corresponding to the sub-projects.
     Each entry is an unsigned integer 0-based index of another
     entry in the main ``projects`` array.

   ``directoryIndexes``
     A JSON array of entries corresponding to build system directories
     that are part of the project.  The first entry corresponds to the
     top-level directory of the project.  Each entry is an unsigned
     integer 0-based index into the main ``directories`` array.

   ``targetIndexes``
     Optional member that is present when the project itself has targets,
     excluding those belonging to sub-projects.  The value is a JSON
     array of entries corresponding to the targets.  Each entry is an
     unsigned integer 0-based index into the main ``targets`` array.

 ``targets``
   A JSON array of entries corresponding to the build system targets.
   Such targets are created by calls to :command:`add_executable`,
   :command:`add_library`, and :command:`add_custom_target`, excluding
   imported targets and interface libraries (which do not generate any
   build rules).  Each entry is a JSON object containing members:

   ``name``
     A string specifying the target name.

   ``id``
     A string uniquely identifying the target.  This matches the ``id``
     field in the file referenced by ``jsonFile``.

   ``directoryIndex``
     An unsigned integer 0-based index into the main ``directories`` array
     indicating the build system directory in which the target is defined.

   ``projectIndex``
     An unsigned integer 0-based index into the main ``projects`` array
     indicating the build system project in which the target is defined.

   ``jsonFile``
     A JSON string specifying a path relative to the codemodel file
     to another JSON file containing a
     `"codemodel" version 2 "target" object`_.

"codemodel" version 2 "target" object
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A codemodel "target" object is referenced by a "codemodel" version 2
object's ``targets`` array.  Each "target" object is a JSON object
with members:

``name``
  A string specifying the logical name of the target.

``id``
  A string uniquely identifying the target.  The format is unspecified

cmake-generator-expressions(7)
******************************

Introduction
============

Generator expressions are evaluated during build system generation to produce
information specific to each build configuration.

Generator expressions are allowed in the context of many target properties,
such as ``LINK_LIBRARIES``, ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and others.  They may also be used when using
commands to populate those properties, such as ``target_link_libraries()``,
``target_include_directories()``, ``target_compile_definitions()``
and others.

They enable conditional linking, conditional definitions used when compiling,
conditional include directories, and more.  The conditions may be based on
the build configuration, target properties, platform information or any other
queryable information.

Generator expressions have the form ``$<...>``.  To avoid confusion, this page
deviates from most of the CMake documentation in that it omits angular brackets
``<...>`` around placeholders like ``condition``, ``string``, ``target``,
among others.

Generator expressions can be nested, as shown in most of the examples below.

Boolean Generator Expressions
=============================

Boolean expressions evaluate to either ``0`` or ``1``.
They are typically used to construct the condition in a :ref:`conditional
generator expression<Conditional Generator Expressions>`.

Available boolean expressions are:

Logical Operators
-----------------

``$<BOOL:string>``
  Converts ``string`` to ``0`` or ``1`` according to the rules of the
  ``if()`` command.  Evaluates to ``0`` if any of the following is true:

  * ``string`` is empty,
  * ``string`` is a case-insensitive equal of
    ``0``, ``FALSE``, ``OFF``, ``N``, ``NO``, ``IGNORE``, or ``NOTFOUND``, or
  * ``string`` ends in the suffix ``-NOTFOUND`` (case-sensitive).

  Otherwise evaluates to ``1``.

``$<AND:conditions>``
  where ``conditions`` is a comma-separated list of boolean expressions.
  Evaluates to ``1`` if all conditions are ``1``.
  Otherwise evaluates to ``0``.

``$<OR:conditions>``
  where ``conditions`` is a comma-separated list of boolean expressions.
  Evaluates to ``1`` if at least one of the conditions is ``1``.
  Otherwise evaluates to ``0``.

``$<NOT:condition>``
  ``0`` if ``condition`` is ``1``, else ``1``.

String Comparisons
------------------

``$<STREQUAL:string1,string2>``
  ``1`` if ``string1`` and ``string2`` are equal, else ``0``.
  The comparison is case-sensitive.  For a case-insensitive comparison,
  combine with a :ref:`string transforming generator expression
  <String Transforming Generator Expressions>`,

  .. code-block:: cmake

    $<STREQUAL:$<UPPER_CASE:${foo}>,"BAR"> # "1" if ${foo} is any of "BAR", "Bar", "bar", ...

``$<EQUAL:value1,value2>``
  ``1`` if ``value1`` and ``value2`` are numerically equal, else ``0``.
``$<IN_LIST:string,list>``
  ``1`` if ``string`` is member of the semicolon-separated ``list``, else ``0``.
  Uses case-sensitive comparisons.
``$<VERSION_LESS:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version less than ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_GREATER:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version greater than ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_EQUAL:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is the same version as ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_LESS_EQUAL:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version less than or equal to ``v2``, else ``0``.
``$<VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL:v1,v2>``
  ``1`` if ``v1`` is a version greater than or equal to ``v2``, else ``0``.


Variable Queries
----------------

``$<TARGET_EXISTS:target>``
  ``1`` if ``target`` exists, else ``0``.
``$<CONFIG:cfg>``
  ``1`` if config is ``cfg``, else ``0``. This is a case-insensitive comparison.
  The mapping in ``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>`` is also considered by
  this expression when it is evaluated on a property on an ``IMPORTED``
  target.
``$<PLATFORM_ID:platform_ids>``
  where ``platform_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's platform id matches any one of the entries in
  ``platform_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable.
``$<C_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``
  where ``compiler_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's compiler id of the C compiler matches any one
  of the entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
``$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``
  where ``compiler_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's compiler id of the CXX compiler matches any one
  of the entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
``$<CUDA_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``
  where ``compiler_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's compiler id of the CUDA compiler matches any one
  of the entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
``$<OBJC_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``
  where ``compiler_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's compiler id of the Objective-C compiler matches any one
  of the entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
``$<OBJCXX_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``
  where ``compiler_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's compiler id of the Objective-C++ compiler matches any one
  of the entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
``$<Fortran_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``
  where ``compiler_ids`` is a comma-separated list.
  ``1`` if the CMake's compiler id of the Fortran compiler matches any one
  of the entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
``$<C_COMPILER_VERSION:version>``
  ``1`` if the version of the C compiler matches ``version``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable.
``$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION:version>``
  ``1`` if the version of the CXX compiler matches ``version``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable.
``$<CUDA_COMPILER_VERSION:version>``
  ``1`` if the version of the CXX compiler matches ``version``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable.
``$<OBJC_COMPILER_VERSION:version>``
  ``1`` if the version of the OBJC compiler matches ``version``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable.
``$<OBJCXX_COMPILER_VERSION:version>``
  ``1`` if the version of the OBJCXX compiler matches ``version``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable.
``$<Fortran_COMPILER_VERSION:version>``
  ``1`` if the version of the Fortran compiler matches ``version``, otherwise ``0``.
  See also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable.
``$<TARGET_POLICY:policy>``
  ``1`` if the ``policy`` was NEW when the 'head' target was created,
  else ``0``.  If the ``policy`` was not set, the warning message for the policy
  will be emitted. This generator expression only works for a subset of
  policies.
``$<COMPILE_FEATURES:features>``
  where ``features`` is a comma-spearated list.
  Evaluates to ``1`` if all of the ``features`` are available for the 'head'
  target, and ``0`` otherwise. If this expression is used while evaluating
  the link implementation of a target and if any dependency transitively
  increases the required ``C_STANDARD`` or ``CXX_STANDARD``
  for the 'head' target, an error is reported.  See the
  ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
  compile features and a list of supported compilers.

``$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:language,compiler_ids>``
  ``1`` when the language used for compilation unit matches ``language`` and
  the CMake's compiler id of the language compiler matches any one of the
  entries in ``compiler_ids``, otherwise ``0``. This expression is a short form
  for the combination of ``$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:language>`` and
  ``$<LANG_COMPILER_ID:compiler_ids>``. This expression may be used to specify
  compile options, compile definitions, and include directories for source files of a
  particular language and compiler combination in a target. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
    target_compile_definitions(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,AppleClang,Clang>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG>
              $<$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:CXX,Intel>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL>
              $<$<COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID:C,Clang>:COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG>
    )

  This specifies the use of different compile definitions based on both
  the compiler id and compilation language. This example will have a
  ``COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG`` compile definition when Clang is the CXX
  compiler, and ``COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL`` when Intel is the CXX compiler.
  Likewise when the C compiler is Clang it will only see the  ``COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG``
  definition.

  Without the ``COMPILE_LANG_AND_ID`` generator expression the same logic
  would be expressed as:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    target_compile_definitions(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<AND:$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>,$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:AppleClang,Clang>>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_CLANG>
              $<$<AND:$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>,$<CXX_COMPILER_ID:Intel>>:COMPILING_CXX_WITH_INTEL>
              $<$<AND:$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:C>,$<C_COMPILER_ID:Clang>>:COMPILING_C_WITH_CLANG>
    )

``$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:languages>``
  ``1`` when the language used for compilation unit matches any of the entries
  in ``languages``, otherwise ``0``.  This expression may be used to specify
  compile options, compile definitions, and include directories for source files of a
  particular language in a target. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_executable(myapp main.cpp foo.c bar.cpp zot.cu)
    target_compile_options(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:-fno-exceptions>
    )
    target_compile_definitions(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX>:COMPILING_CXX>
              $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CUDA>:COMPILING_CUDA>
    )
    target_include_directories(myapp
      PRIVATE $<$<COMPILE_LANGUAGE:CXX,CUDA>:/opt/foo/headers>
    )

  This specifies the use of the ``-fno-exceptions`` compile option,
  ``COMPILING_CXX`` compile definition, and ``cxx_headers`` include
  directory for C++ only (compiler id checks elided).  It also specifies
  a ``COMPILING_CUDA`` compile definition for CUDA.

  Note that with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and ``Xcode`` there
  is no way to represent target-wide compile definitions or include directories
  separately for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.
  Also, with :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` there is no way to represent
  target-wide flags separately for ``C`` and ``CXX`` languages.  Under these
  generators, expressions for both C and C++ sources will be evaluated
  using ``CXX`` if there are any C++ sources and otherwise using ``C``.
  A workaround is to create separate libraries for each source file language
  instead:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_library(myapp_c foo.c)
    add_library(myapp_cxx bar.cpp)
    target_compile_options(myapp_cxx PUBLIC -fno-exceptions)
    add_executable(myapp main.cpp)
    target_link_libraries(myapp myapp_c myapp_cxx)

String-Valued Generator Expressions
===================================

These expressions expand to some string.
For example,

 include_directories(/usr/include/$<CXX_COMPILER_ID>/)

expands to ``/usr/include/GNU/`` or ``/usr/include/Clang/`` etc, depending on
the compiler identifier.

String-valued expressions may also be combined with other expressions.
Here an example for a string-valued expression within a boolean expressions
within a conditional expression:

 $<$<VERSION_LESS:$<CXX_COMPILER_VERSION>,4.2.0>:OLD_COMPILER>

expands to ``OLD_COMPILER`` if the
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_VERSION`` is less
than 4.2.0.

And here two nested string-valued expressions:

 -I$<JOIN:$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>, -I>

generates a string of the entries in the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target
property with each entry preceded by ``-I``.

Expanding on the previous example, if one first wants to check if the
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` property is non-empty, then it is advisable to
introduce a helper variable to keep the code readable:

 set(prop "$<TARGET_PROPERTY:INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES>") # helper variable
 $<$<BOOL:${prop}>:-I$<JOIN:${prop}, -I>>

The following string-valued generator expressions are available:

Escaped Characters
------------------

String literals to escape the special meaning a character would otherwise have:

``$<ANGLE-R>``
  A literal ``>``. Used for example to compare strings that contain a ``>``.
``$<COMMA>``
  A literal ``,``. Used for example to compare strings which contain a ``,``.
``$<SEMICOLON>``
  A literal ``;``. Used to prevent list expansion on an argument with ``;``.

Conditional Expressions
-----------------------

Conditional generator expressions depend on a boolean condition
that must be ``0`` or ``1``.

``$<condition:true_string>``
  Evaluates to ``true_string`` if ``condition`` is ``1``.
  Otherwise evaluates to the empty string.

``$<IF:condition,true_string,false_string>``
  Evaluates to ``true_string`` if ``condition`` is ``1``.
  Otherwise evaluates to ``false_string``.

Typically, the ``condition`` is a :ref:`boolean generator expression
<Boolean Generator Expressions>`.  For instance,

 $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>

expands to ``DEBUG_MODE`` when the ``Debug`` configuration is used, and
otherwise expands to the empty string.

String Transformations
----------------------

``$<JOIN:list,string>``
  Joins the list with the content of ``string``.
``$<REMOVE_DUPLICATES:list>``
  Removes duplicated items in the given ``list``.
``$<FILTER:list,INCLUDE|EXCLUDE,regex>``
  Includes or removes items from ``list`` that match the regular expression ``regex``.
``$<LOWER_CASE:string>``
  Content of ``string`` converted to lower case.
``$<UPPER_CASE:string>``
  Content of ``string`` converted to upper case.

``$<GENEX_EVAL:expr>``
  Content of ``expr`` evaluated as a generator expression in the current
  context. This enables consumption of generator expressions whose
  evaluation results itself in generator expressions.
``$<TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:tgt,expr>``
  Content of ``expr`` evaluated as a generator expression in the context of
  ``tgt`` target. This enables consumption of custom target properties that
  themselves contain generator expressions.

  Having the capability to evaluate generator expressions is very useful when
  you want to manage custom properties supporting generator expressions.
  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_library(foo ...)

    set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
      CUSTOM_KEYS $<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>
    )

    add_custom_target(printFooKeys
      COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo $<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>
    )

  This naive implementation of the ``printFooKeys`` custom command is wrong
  because ``CUSTOM_KEYS`` target property is not evaluated and the content
  is passed as is (i.e. ``$<$<CONFIG:DEBUG>:FOO_EXTRA_THINGS>``).

  To have the expected result (i.e. ``FOO_EXTRA_THINGS`` if config is
  ``Debug``), it is required to evaluate the output of
  ``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    add_custom_target(printFooKeys
      COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E
        echo $<TARGET_GENEX_EVAL:foo,$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,CUSTOM_KEYS>>
    )

``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``
  Content of the install prefix when the target is exported via
  ``install(EXPORT)`` and empty otherwise.

Output-Related Expressions
--------------------------

``$<TARGET_NAME:...>``
  Marks ``...`` as being the name of a target.  This is required if exporting
  targets to multiple dependent export sets.  The ``...`` must be a literal
  name of a target- it may not contain generator expressions.
``$<LINK_ONLY:...>``
  Content of ``...`` except when evaluated in a link interface while
  propagating :ref:`Target Usage Requirements`, in which case it is the
  empty string.
  Intended for use only in an ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` target
  property, perhaps via the ``target_link_libraries()`` command,
  to specify private link dependencies without other usage requirements.
``$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:...>``
  Content of ``...`` when the property is exported using ``install(EXPORT)``,
  and empty otherwise.
``$<BUILD_INTERFACE:...>``
  Content of ``...`` when the property is exported using ``export()``, or
  when the target is used by another target in the same buildsystem. Expands to
  the empty string otherwise.
``$<MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER:...>``
  Content of ``...`` converted to a C identifier.  The conversion follows the
  same behavior as ``string(MAKE_C_IDENTIFIER)``.
``$<TARGET_OBJECTS:objLib>``
  List of objects resulting from build of ``objLib``.
``$<SHELL_PATH:...>``
  Content of ``...`` converted to shell path style. For example, slashes are
  converted to backslashes in Windows shells and drive letters are converted
  to posix paths in MSYS shells. The ``...`` must be an absolute path.
  The ``...`` may be a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>`
  of paths, in which case each path is converted individually and a result
  list is generated using the shell path separator (``:`` on POSIX and
  ``;`` on Windows).  Be sure to enclose the argument containing this genex
  in double quotes in CMake source code so that ``;`` does not split arguments.

Debugging
=========

Since generator expressions are evaluated during generation of the buildsystem,
and not during processing of ``CMakeLists.txt`` files, it is not possible to
inspect their result with the ``message()`` command.

One possible way to generate debug messages is to add a custom target,

 add_custom_target(genexdebug COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "$<...>")

The shell command ``make genexdebug`` (invoked after execution of ``cmake``)
would then print the result of ``$<...>``.

Another way is to write debug messages to a file:

 file(GENERATE OUTPUT filename CONTENT "$<...>")

cmake-generators(7)
*******************

Introduction
============

A *CMake Generator* is responsible for writing the input files for
a native build system.  Exactly one of the CMake Generators must be
selected for a build tree to determine what native build system is to
be used.  Optionally one of the Extra Generators may be selected
as a variant of some of the Command-Line Build Tool Generators to
produce project files for an auxiliary IDE.

CMake Generators are platform-specific so each may be available only
on certain platforms.  The ``cmake(1)`` command-line tool ``--help``
output lists available generators on the current platform.  Use its ``-G``
option to specify the generator for a new build tree.
The ``cmake-gui(1)`` offers interactive selection of a generator
when creating a new build tree.

CMake Generators
================

Command-Line Build Tool Generators
----------------------------------

These generators support command-line build tools.  In order to use them,
one must launch CMake from a command-line prompt whose environment is
already configured for the chosen compiler and build tool.

Makefile Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Borland Makefiles
-----------------

Generates Borland makefiles.

MSYS Makefiles
--------------

Generates makefiles for use with MSYS (Minimal SYStem)
``make`` under the MSYS shell.

Use this generator in a MSYS shell prompt and using ``make`` as the build
tool.  The generated makefiles use ``/bin/sh`` as the shell to launch build
rules.  They are not compatible with a Windows command prompt.

To build under a Windows command prompt, use the
``MinGW Makefiles`` generator.

MinGW Makefiles
---------------

Generates makefiles for use with ``mingw32-make`` under a Windows command
prompt.

Use this generator under a Windows command prompt with
MinGW (Minimalist GNU for Windows) in the ``PATH``
and using ``mingw32-make`` as the build tool.  The generated makefiles use
``cmd.exe`` as the shell to launch build rules.  They are not compatible with
MSYS or a unix shell.

To build under the MSYS shell, use the ``MSYS Makefiles`` generator.

NMake Makefiles
---------------

Generates NMake makefiles.

NMake Makefiles JOM
-------------------

Generates JOM makefiles.

Unix Makefiles
--------------

Generates standard UNIX makefiles.

A hierarchy of UNIX makefiles is generated into the build tree.  Use
any standard UNIX-style make program to build the project through
the ``all`` target and install the project through the ``install``
(or ``install/strip``) target.

For each subdirectory ``sub/dir`` of the project a UNIX makefile will
be created, containing the following targets:

``all``
  Depends on all targets required by the subdirectory.

``install``
  Runs the install step in the subdirectory, if any.

``install/strip``
  Runs the install step in the subdirectory followed by a ``CMAKE_STRIP`` command,
  if any.

  The ``CMAKE_STRIP`` variable will contain the platform's ``strip`` utility, which
  removes symbols information from generated binaries.

``test``
  Runs the test step in the subdirectory, if any.

``package``
  Runs the package step in the subdirectory, if any.

Watcom WMake
------------

Generates Watcom WMake makefiles.

Ninja Generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ninja
-----

Generates build.ninja files.

A ``build.ninja`` file is generated into the build tree.  Use the ninja
program to build the project through the ``all`` target and install the
project through the ``install`` (or ``install/strip``) target.

For each subdirectory ``sub/dir`` of the project, additional targets
are generated:

``sub/dir/all``
  Depends on all targets required by the subdirectory.

``sub/dir/install``
  Runs the install step in the subdirectory, if any.

``sub/dir/install/strip``
  Runs the install step in the subdirectory followed by a ``CMAKE_STRIP`` command,
  if any.

  The ``CMAKE_STRIP`` variable will contain the platform's ``strip`` utility, which
  removes symbols information from generated binaries.

``sub/dir/test``
  Runs the test step in the subdirectory, if any.

``sub/dir/package``
  Runs the package step in the subdirectory, if any.

Fortran Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Ninja`` generator conditionally supports Fortran when the ``ninja``
tool has the required features.  As of this version of CMake the needed
features have not been integrated into upstream Ninja.  Kitware maintains
a branch of Ninja with the required features on github.com/Kitware/ninja.


IDE Build Tool Generators
-------------------------

These generators support Integrated Development Environment (IDE)
project files.  Since the IDEs configure their own environment
one may launch CMake from any environment.

Visual Studio Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Visual Studio 6
---------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 6 project files, but the
generator has been removed since CMake 3.6.  It is still possible to
build with VS 6 tools using the ``NMake Makefiles`` generator.

Visual Studio 7
---------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio .NET 2002 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.6.  It is still possible to
build with VS 7.0 tools using the ``NMake Makefiles`` generator.

Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003
-------------------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio .NET 2003 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.9.  It is still possible to
build with VS 7.1 tools using the ``NMake Makefiles`` generator.

Visual Studio 8 2005
--------------------

Removed.  This once generated Visual Studio 8 2005 project files, but
the generator has been removed since CMake 3.12.  It is still possible to
build with VS 2005 tools using the ``NMake Makefiles`` generator.

Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default target platform name (architecture) is ``Win32``.

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-A`` option, to specify a target platform

Visual Studio 11 2012
---------------------

Generates Visual Studio 11 (VS 2012) project files.

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.0, one may specify this
generator using the name "Visual Studio 11" without the year component.

Project Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Visual C++ and C# projects may be generated.  Other types of
projects (JavaScript, Database, Website, etc.) are not supported.

Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default target platform name (architecture) is ``Win32``.

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable may be set, perhaps

* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 2012" -A x64``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 2012" -A ARM``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 11 2012" -A <WinCE-SDK>``
  (Specify a target platform matching a Windows CE SDK name.)

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.1, one may specify
a target platform name optionally at the end of the generator name.
This is supported only for:

``Visual Studio 11 2012 Win64``
  Specify target platform ``x64``.

``Visual Studio 11 2012 ARM``
  Specify target platform ``ARM``.

``Visual Studio 11 2012 <WinCE-SDK>``

default.  The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

Visual Studio 12 2013
---------------------

Generates Visual Studio 12 (VS 2013) project files.

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.0, one may specify this
generator using the name "Visual Studio 12" without the year component.

Project Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Visual C++ and C# projects may be generated.  Other types of
projects (JavaScript, Powershell, Python, etc.) are not supported.

Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default target platform name (architecture) is ``Win32``.

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable may be set, perhaps

name (architecture).  For example:

* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -A Win32``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -A x64``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 12 2013" -A ARM``

a target platform name optionally at the end of the generator name.
This is supported only for:

``Visual Studio 12 2013 Win64``
  Specify target platform ``x64``.

``Visual Studio 12 2013 ARM``
  Specify target platform ``ARM``.

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``v120`` toolset that comes with Visual Studio 12 2013 is selected by
default.  The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

For each toolset that comes with this version of Visual Studio, there are
variants that are themselves compiled for 32-bit (``x86``) and
64-bit (``x64``) hosts (independent of the architecture they target).
By default this generator uses the 32-bit variant even on a 64-bit host.
One may explicitly request use of either the 32-bit or 64-bit host tools
by adding either ``host=x86`` or ``host=x64`` to the toolset specification.
See the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

Visual Studio 14 2015
---------------------

Generates Visual Studio 14 (VS 2015) project files.

Project Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Visual C++ and C# projects may be generated.  Other types of
projects (JavaScript, Powershell, Python, etc.) are not supported.

Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default target platform name (architecture) is ``Win32``.

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-A`` option, to specify a target platform
name (architecture).  For example:

* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A Win32``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A x64``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 14 2015" -A ARM``

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.1, one may specify
a target platform name optionally at the end of the generator name.
This is supported only for:

``Visual Studio 14 2015 Win64``
  Specify target platform ``x64``.

``Visual Studio 14 2015 ARM``
  Specify target platform ``ARM``.

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``v140`` toolset that comes with Visual Studio 14 2015 is selected by
default.  The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

For each toolset that comes with this version of Visual Studio, there are
variants that are themselves compiled for 32-bit (``x86``) and
64-bit (``x64``) hosts (independent of the architecture they target).
By default this generator uses the 32-bit variant even on a 64-bit host.
One may explicitly request use of either the 32-bit or 64-bit host tools
by adding either ``host=x86`` or ``host=x64`` to the toolset specification.
See the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

Visual Studio 15 2017
---------------------

Generates Visual Studio 15 (VS 2017) project files.

Project Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Visual C++ and C# projects may be generated.  Other types of
projects (JavaScript, Powershell, Python, etc.) are not supported.

Instance Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VS 2017 supports multiple installations on the same machine.
The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` variable may be set as a
cache entry containing the absolute path to a Visual Studio instance.
If the value is not specified explicitly by the user or a toolchain file,
CMake queries the Visual Studio Installer to locate VS instances, chooses
one, and sets the variable as a cache entry to hold the value persistently.

When CMake first chooses an instance, if the ``VS150COMNTOOLS`` environment
variable is set and points to the ``Common7/Tools`` directory within
one of the instances, that instance will be used.  Otherwise, if more
than one instance is installed we do not define which one is chosen
by default.

Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default target platform name (architecture) is ``Win32``.

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-A`` option, to specify a target platform
name (architecture).  For example:

* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A Win32``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A x64``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A ARM``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 15 2017" -A ARM64``

For compatibility with CMake versions prior to 3.1, one may specify
a target platform name optionally at the end of the generator name.
This is supported only for:

``Visual Studio 15 2017 Win64``
  Specify target platform ``x64``.

``Visual Studio 15 2017 ARM``
  Specify target platform ``ARM``.

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``v141`` toolset that comes with Visual Studio 15 2017 is selected by
default.  The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

For each toolset that comes with this version of Visual Studio, there are
variants that are themselves compiled for 32-bit (``x86``) and
64-bit (``x64``) hosts (independent of the architecture they target).
By default this generator uses the 32-bit variant even on a 64-bit host.
One may explicitly request use of either the 32-bit or 64-bit host tools
by adding either ``host=x86`` or ``host=x64`` to the toolset specification.
See the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

Visual Studio 16 2019
---------------------

Generates Visual Studio 16 (VS 2019) project files.

Project Types
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Only Visual C++ and C# projects may be generated.  Other types of
projects (JavaScript, Powershell, Python, etc.) are not supported.

Instance Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

VS 2019 supports multiple installations on the same machine.
The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` variable may be set as a
cache entry containing the absolute path to a Visual Studio instance.
If the value is not specified explicitly by the user or a toolchain file,
CMake queries the Visual Studio Installer to locate VS instances, chooses
one, and sets the variable as a cache entry to hold the value persistently.

When CMake first chooses an instance, if the ``VS160COMNTOOLS`` environment
variable is set and points to the ``Common7/Tools`` directory within
one of the instances, that instance will be used.  Otherwise, if more
than one instance is installed we do not define which one is chosen
by default.

Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The default target platform name (architecture) is that of the host
and is provided in the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT`` variable.

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-A`` option, to specify a target platform
name (architecture).  For example:

* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A Win32``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A x64``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A ARM``
* ``cmake -G "Visual Studio 16 2019" -A ARM64``

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``v142`` toolset that comes with Visual Studio 16 2019 is selected by
default.  The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

For each toolset that comes with this version of Visual Studio, there are
variants that are themselves compiled for 32-bit (``x86``) and
64-bit (``x64``) hosts (independent of the architecture they target).
By default this generator uses the 64-bit variant on x64 hosts and the 32-bit variant otherwise.
One may explicitly request use of either the 32-bit or 64-bit host tools
by adding either ``host=x86`` or ``host=x64`` to the toolset specification.
See the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

Other Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Green Hills MULTI
-----------------

Generates Green Hills MULTI project files (experimental, work-in-progress).

The buildsystem has predetermined build-configuration settings that can be controlled
via the ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` variable.

Customizations that are used to pick toolset and target system:

The ``-A <arch>`` can be supplied for setting the target architecture.
``<arch>`` usually is one of ``arm``, ``ppc``, ``86``, etcetera.
If the target architecture is not specified then
the default architecture of ``arm`` will be used.

The ``-T <toolset>`` option can be used to set the directory location of the toolset.
Both absolute and relative paths are valid. Relative paths use ``GHS_TOOLSET_ROOT``
as the root. If the toolset is not specified then the latest toolset found in
``GHS_TOOLSET_ROOT`` will be used.

Cache variables that are used for toolset and target system customization:

* ``GHS_TARGET_PLATFORM``

  | Defaults to ``integrity``.
  | Usual values are ``integrity``, ``threadx``, ``uvelosity``, ``velosity``,
    ``vxworks``, ``standalone``.

* ``GHS_PRIMARY_TARGET``

  | Sets ``primaryTarget`` entry in project file.
  | Defaults to ``<arch>_<GHS_TARGET_PLATFORM>.tgt``.

* ``GHS_TOOLSET_ROOT``

  | Root path for ``toolset`` searches.
  | Defaults to ``C:/ghs`` in Windows or ``/usr/ghs`` in Linux.

* ``GHS_OS_ROOT``

  | Root path for RTOS searches.
  | Defaults to ``C:/ghs`` in Windows or ``/usr/ghs`` in Linux.

* ``GHS_OS_DIR`` and ``GHS_OS_DIR_OPTION``

  | Sets ``-os_dir`` entry in project file.
  | Defaults to latest platform OS installation at ``GHS_OS_ROOT``.  Set this value if
    a specific RTOS is to be used.
  | ``GHS_OS_DIR_OPTION`` default value is ``-os_dir``.

* ``GHS_BSP_NAME``

  | Sets ``-bsp`` entry in project file.
  | Defaults to ``sim<arch>`` for ``integrity`` platforms.

Customizations are available through the following cache variables:

* ``GHS_CUSTOMIZATION``
* ``GHS_GPJ_MACROS``

The following properties are available:

* ``GHS_INTEGRITY_APP``
* ``GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE``

.. note::
  This generator is deemed experimental as of CMake 3.16.0-rc3
  and is still a work in progress.  Future versions of CMake
  may make breaking changes as the generator matures.

Xcode
-----

Generate Xcode project files.

This supports Xcode 5.0 and above.

Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default Xcode is allowed to select its own default toolchain.
The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option may be set, perhaps
via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option, to specify another toolset.

Extra Generators
================

Some of the CMake Generators listed in the ``cmake(1)``
command-line tool ``--help`` output may have variants that specify
an extra generator for an auxiliary IDE tool.  Such generator
names have the form ``<extra-generator> - <main-generator>``.
The following extra generators are known to CMake.

CodeBlocks
----------

Generates CodeBlocks project files.

Project files for CodeBlocks will be created in the top directory and
in every subdirectory which features a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file containing
a ``project()`` call.  Additionally a hierarchy of makefiles is generated
into the build tree.
The ``CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES`` variable may
be set to ``ON`` to exclude any files which are located outside of
the project root directory.
The appropriate make program can build the
project through the default ``all`` target.  An ``install`` target is
also provided.

This "extra" generator may be specified as:

``CodeBlocks - MinGW Makefiles``
 Generate with ``MinGW Makefiles``.

Project files for CodeLite will be created in the top directory and
in every subdirectory which features a CMakeLists.txt file containing
a ``project()`` call.
The ``CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS`` variable may be set to ``ON``
to change the default behavior from projects to targets as the basis
for project files.
The appropriate make program can build the
project through the default ``all`` target.  An ``install`` target
is also provided.

cmake-language(7)
*****************

Organization
============

CMake input files are written in the "CMake Language" in source files
named ``CMakeLists.txt`` or ending in a ``.cmake`` file name extension.

CMake Language source files in a project are organized into:

* Directories (``CMakeLists.txt``),
* Scripts (``<script>.cmake``), and
* Modules (``<module>.cmake``).

Directories
-----------

When CMake processes a project source tree, the entry point is
a source file called ``CMakeLists.txt`` in the top-level source
directory.  This file may contain the entire build specification
or use the ``add_subdirectory()`` command to add subdirectories
to the build.  Each subdirectory added by the command must also
contain a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file as the entry point to that
directory.  For each source directory whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` file
is processed CMake generates a corresponding directory in the build
tree to act as the default working and output directory.

Scripts
-------

An individual ``<script>.cmake`` source file may be processed
in *script mode* by using the ``cmake(1)`` command-line tool
with the ``-P`` option.  Script mode simply runs the commands in
the given CMake Language source file and does not generate a
build system.  It does not allow CMake commands that define build
targets or actions.

Modules
-------

CMake Language code in either Directories or Scripts may
use the ``include()`` command to load a ``<module>.cmake``
source file in the scope of the including context.
See the ``cmake-modules(7)`` manual page for documentation
of modules included with the CMake distribution.
Project source trees may also provide their own modules and
specify their location(s) in the ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``
variable.

Syntax
======

Encoding
--------

A CMake Language source file may be written in 7-bit ASCII text for
maximum portability across all supported platforms.  Newlines may be
encoded as either ``\n`` or ``\r\n`` but will be converted to ``\n``
as input files are read.

Note that the implementation is 8-bit clean so source files may
be encoded as UTF-8 on platforms with system APIs supporting this
encoding.  In addition, CMake 3.2 and above support source files
encoded in UTF-8 on Windows (using UTF-16 to call system APIs).
Furthermore, CMake 3.0 and above allow a leading UTF-8
Byte-Order Mark in source files.

Source Files
------------

A CMake Language source file consists of zero or more
Command Invocations separated by newlines and optionally
spaces and Comments:

.. productionlist::
 file: `file_element`*
 file_element: `command_invocation` `line_ending` |
             : (`bracket_comment`|`space`)* `line_ending`
 line_ending: `line_comment`? `newline`
 space: <match '[ \t]+'>
 newline: <match '\n'>

Note that any source file line not inside Command Arguments or
a Bracket Comment can end in a Line Comment.

Command Invocations
-------------------

A *command invocation* is a name followed by paren-enclosed arguments
separated by whitespace:

.. productionlist::
 command_invocation: `space`* `identifier` `space`* '(' `arguments` ')'
 identifier: <match '[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*'>
 arguments: `argument`? `separated_arguments`*
 separated_arguments: `separation`+ `argument`? |
                    : `separation`* '(' `arguments` ')'
 separation: `space` | `line_ending`

For example:

 add_executable(hello world.c)

Command names are case-insensitive.
Nested unquoted parentheses in the arguments must balance.
Each ``(`` or ``)`` is given to the command invocation as
a literal Unquoted Argument.  This may be used in calls
to the ``if()`` command to enclose conditions.
For example:

 if(FALSE AND (FALSE OR TRUE)) # evaluates to FALSE

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 require command name identifiers
 to be at least 2 characters.

 CMake versions prior to 2.8.12 silently accept an Unquoted Argument
 or a Quoted Argument immediately following a Quoted Argument and
 not separated by any whitespace.  For compatibility, CMake 2.8.12 and
 higher accept such code but produce a warning.

Command Arguments
-----------------

There are three types of arguments within Command Invocations:

.. productionlist::
 argument: `bracket_argument` | `quoted_argument` | `unquoted_argument`

Bracket Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *bracket argument*, inspired by Lua long bracket syntax,
encloses content between opening and closing "brackets" of the
same length:

.. productionlist::
 bracket_argument: `bracket_open` `bracket_content` `bracket_close`
 bracket_open: '[' '='* '['
 bracket_content: <any text not containing a `bracket_close` with
                :  the same number of '=' as the `bracket_open`>
 bracket_close: ']' '='* ']'

An opening bracket is written ``[`` followed by zero or more ``=`` followed
by ``[``.  The corresponding closing bracket is written ``]`` followed
by the same number of ``=`` followed by ``]``.
Brackets do not nest.  A unique length may always be chosen
for the opening and closing brackets to contain closing brackets
of other lengths.

Bracket argument content consists of all text between the opening
and closing brackets, except that one newline immediately following
the opening bracket, if any, is ignored.  No evaluation of the
enclosed content, such as Escape Sequences or Variable References,
is performed.  A bracket argument is always given to the command
invocation as exactly one argument.

For example::

 message([=[
 This is the first line in a bracket argument with bracket length 1.
 No \-escape sequences or ${variable} references are evaluated.
 This is always one argument even though it contains a ; character.
 The text does not end on a closing bracket of length 0 like ]].
 It does end in a closing bracket of length 1.
 ]=])

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 do not support bracket arguments.
 They interpret the opening bracket as the start of an
 Unquoted Argument.

Quoted Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A *quoted argument* encloses content between opening and closing
double-quote characters:

.. productionlist::
 quoted_argument: '"' `quoted_element`* '"'
 quoted_element: <any character except '\' or '"'> |
                 : `escape_sequence` |
                 : `quoted_continuation`
 quoted_continuation: '\' `newline`

Quoted argument content consists of all text between opening and
closing quotes.  Both Escape Sequences and Variable References
are evaluated.  A quoted argument is always given to the command
invocation as exactly one argument.

For example:

 message("This is a quoted argument containing multiple lines.
 This is always one argument even though it contains a ; character.
 Both \\-escape sequences and ${variable} references are evaluated.
 The text does not end on an escaped double-quote like \".
 It does end in an unescaped double quote.
 ")

The final ``\`` on any line ending in an odd number of backslashes
is treated as a line continuation and ignored along with the
immediately following newline character.  For example:

 message("\
 This is the first line of a quoted argument. \
 In fact it is the only line but since it is long \
 the source code uses line continuation.\
 ")

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 do not support continuation with ``\``.
 They report errors in quoted arguments containing lines ending in
 an odd number of ``\`` characters.

Unquoted Argument
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An *unquoted argument* is not enclosed by any quoting syntax.
It may not contain any whitespace, ``(``, ``)``, ``#``, ``"``, or ``\``
except when escaped by a backslash:

.. productionlist::
 unquoted_argument: `unquoted_element`+ | `unquoted_legacy`
 unquoted_element: <any character except whitespace or one of '()#"\'> |
                 : `escape_sequence`
 unquoted_legacy: <see note in text>

Unquoted argument content consists of all text in a contiguous block
of allowed or escaped characters.  Both Escape Sequences and
Variable References are evaluated.  The resulting value is divided
in the same way Lists divide into elements.  Each non-empty element
is given to the command invocation as an argument.  Therefore an
unquoted argument may be given to a command invocation as zero or
more arguments.

For example:

 foreach(arg
     NoSpace
     Escaped\ Space
     This;Divides;Into;Five;Arguments
     Escaped\;Semicolon
     )
   message("${arg}")
 endforeach()

.. note::
 To support legacy CMake code, unquoted arguments may also contain
 double-quoted strings (``"..."``, possibly enclosing horizontal
 whitespace), and make-style variable references (``$(MAKEVAR)``).

 Unescaped double-quotes must balance, may not appear at the
 beginning of an unquoted argument, and are treated as part of the
 content.  For example, the unquoted arguments ``-Da="b c"``,
 ``-Da=$(v)``, and ``a" "b"c"d`` are each interpreted literally.
 They may instead be written as quoted arguments ``"-Da=\"b c\""``,
 ``"-Da=$(v)"``, and ``"a\" \"b\"c\"d"``, respectively.

 Make-style references are treated literally as part of the content
 and do not undergo variable expansion.  They are treated as part
 of a single argument (rather than as separate ``$``, ``(``,
 ``MAKEVAR``, and ``)`` arguments).

 The above "unquoted_legacy" production represents such arguments.
 We do not recommend using legacy unquoted arguments in new code.
 Instead use a Quoted Argument or a Bracket Argument to
 represent the content.

Escape Sequences
----------------

An *escape sequence* is a ``\`` followed by one character:

.. productionlist::
 escape_sequence: `escape_identity` | `escape_encoded` | `escape_semicolon`
 escape_identity: '\' <match '[^A-Za-z0-9;]'>
 escape_encoded: '\t' | '\r' | '\n'
 escape_semicolon: '\;'

A ``\`` followed by a non-alphanumeric character simply encodes the literal
character without interpreting it as syntax.  A ``\t``, ``\r``, or ``\n``
encodes a tab, carriage return, or newline character, respectively. A ``\;``
outside of any Variable References  encodes itself but may be used in an
Unquoted Argument to encode the ``;`` without dividing the argument
value on it.  A ``\;`` inside Variable References encodes the literal
``;`` character.  (See also policy ``CMP0053`` documentation for
historical considerations.)

Variable References
-------------------

A *variable reference* has the form ``${<variable>}`` and is
evaluated inside a Quoted Argument or an Unquoted Argument.
A variable reference is replaced by the value of the variable,
or by the empty string if the variable is not set.
Variable references can nest and are evaluated from the
inside out, e.g. ``${outer_${inner_variable}_variable}``.

Literal variable references may consist of alphanumeric characters,
the characters ``/_.+-``, and Escape Sequences.  Nested references
may be used to evaluate variables of any name.  See also policy
``CMP0053`` documentation for historical considerations and reasons why
the ``$`` is also technically permitted but is discouraged.

The Variables section documents the scope of variable names
and how their values are set.

An *environment variable reference* has the form ``$ENV{<variable>}``.
See the Environment Variables section for more information.

A *cache variable reference* has the form ``$CACHE{<variable>}``.
See ``CACHE`` for more information.

The ``if()`` command has a special condition syntax that
allows for variable references in the short form ``<variable>``
instead of ``${<variable>}``.
However, environment and cache variables always need to be
referenced as ``$ENV{<variable>}`` or ``$CACHE{<variable>}``.

Comments
--------

A comment starts with a ``#`` character that is not inside a
Bracket Argument, Quoted Argument, or escaped with ``\``
as part of an Unquoted Argument.  There are two types of
comments: a Bracket Comment and a Line Comment.

Bracket Comment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``#`` immediately followed by a :token:`bracket_open` forms a
*bracket comment* consisting of the entire bracket enclosure:

.. productionlist::
 bracket_comment: '#' `bracket_argument`

For example:

::

 #[[This is a bracket comment.
 It runs until the close bracket.]]
 message("First Argument\n" #[[Bracket Comment]] "Second Argument")

.. note::
 CMake versions prior to 3.0 do not support bracket comments.
 They interpret the opening ``#`` as the start of a Line Comment.

Line Comment
^^^^^^^^^^^^

A ``#`` not immediately followed by a :token:`bracket_open` forms a
*line comment* that runs until the end of the line:

.. productionlist::
 line_comment: '#' <any text not starting in a `bracket_open`
             :      and not containing a `newline`>

For example:

 # This is a line comment.
 message("First Argument\n" # This is a line comment :)
         "Second Argument") # This is a line comment.

Control Structures
==================

Conditional Blocks
------------------

The ``if()``/``elseif()``/``else()``/``endif()``
commands delimit code blocks to be executed conditionally.

Loops
-----

The ``foreach()``/``endforeach()`` and
``while()``/``endwhile()`` commands delimit code
blocks to be executed in a loop.  Inside such blocks the
``break()`` command may be used to terminate the loop
early whereas the ``continue()`` command may be used
to start with the next iteration immediately.

Command Definitions
-------------------

The ``macro()``/``endmacro()``, and
``function()``/``endfunction()`` commands delimit
code blocks to be recorded for later invocation as commands.

Variables
=========

Variables are the basic unit of storage in the CMake Language.
Their values are always of string type, though some commands may
interpret the strings as values of other types.
The ``set()`` and ``unset()`` commands explicitly
set or unset a variable, but other commands have semantics
that modify variables as well.
Variable names are case-sensitive and may consist of almost
any text, but we recommend sticking to names consisting only
of alphanumeric characters plus ``_`` and ``-``.

Variables have dynamic scope.  Each variable "set" or "unset"
creates a binding in the current scope:

Function Scope
 Command Definitions created by the ``function()`` command
 create commands that, when invoked, process the recorded commands
 in a new variable binding scope.  A variable "set" or "unset"
 binds in this scope and is visible for the current function and
 any nested calls within it, but not after the function returns.

Directory Scope
 Each of the Directories in a source tree has its own variable
 bindings.  Before processing the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file for a
 directory, CMake copies all variable bindings currently defined
 in the parent directory, if any, to initialize the new directory
 scope.  CMake Scripts, when processed with ``cmake -P``, bind
 variables in one "directory" scope.

 A variable "set" or "unset" not inside a function call binds
 to the current directory scope.

Persistent Cache
 CMake stores a separate set of "cache" variables, or "cache entries",
 whose values persist across multiple runs within a project build
 tree.  Cache entries have an isolated binding scope modified only
 by explicit request, such as by the ``CACHE`` option of the
 ``set()`` and ``unset()`` commands.

When evaluating Variable References, CMake first searches the
function call stack, if any, for a binding and then falls back
to the binding in the current directory scope, if any.  If a
"set" binding is found, its value is used.  If an "unset" binding
is found, or no binding is found, CMake then searches for a
cache entry.  If a cache entry is found, its value is used.
Otherwise, the variable reference evaluates to an empty string.
The ``$CACHE{VAR}`` syntax can be used to do direct cache entry
lookups.

The ``cmake-variables(7)`` manual documents the many variables
that are provided by CMake or have meaning to CMake when set
by project code.

Environment Variables
=====================

Environment Variables are like ordinary Variables, with the
following differences:

Scope
 Environment variables have global scope in a CMake process.
 They are never cached.

References
 Variable References have the form ``$ENV{<variable>}``.

Initialization
 Initial values of the CMake environment variables are those of
 the calling process.
 Values can be changed using the ``set()`` and ``unset()``
 commands.
 These commands only affect the running CMake process,
 not the system environment at large.
 Changed values are not written back to the calling process,
 and they are not seen by subsequent build or test processes.

The ``cmake-env-variables(7)`` manual documents environment
variables that have special meaning to CMake.

Lists
=====

Although all values in CMake are stored as strings, a string
may be treated as a list in certain contexts, such as during
evaluation of an Unquoted Argument.  In such contexts, a string
is divided into list elements by splitting on ``;`` characters not
following an unequal number of ``[`` and ``]`` characters and not
immediately preceded by a ``\``.  The sequence ``\;`` does not
divide a value but is replaced by ``;`` in the resulting element.

A list of elements is represented as a string by concatenating
the elements separated by ``;``.  For example, the ``set()``
command stores multiple values into the destination variable
as a list:

 set(srcs a.c b.c c.c) # sets "srcs" to "a.c;b.c;c.c"

Lists are meant for simple use cases such as a list of source
files and should not be used for complex data processing tasks.
Most commands that construct lists do not escape ``;`` characters
in list elements, thus flattening nested lists:

 set(x a "b;c") # sets "x" to "a;b;c", not "a;b\;c"

cmake-modules(7)
****************

The modules listed here are part of the CMake distribution.
Projects may provide further modules; their location(s)
can be specified in the ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` variable.

Utility Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These modules are loaded using the ``include()`` command.

AddFileDependencies
-------------------

Add dependencies to a source file.

 ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<source> <files>)

Adds the given ``<files>`` to the dependencies of file ``<source>``.

AndroidTestUtilities
------------------------

Create a test that automatically loads specified data onto an Android device.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use this module to push data needed for testing an Android device behavior
onto a connected Android device. The module will accept files and libraries as
well as separate destinations for each. It will create a test that loads the
files into a device object store and link to them from the specified
destination. The files are only uploaded if they are not already in the object
store.

For example:

 include(AndroidTestUtilities)
 android_add_test_data(
   example_setup_test
   FILES <files>...
   LIBS <libs>...
   DEVICE_TEST_DIR "/data/local/tests/example"
   DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE "/sdcard/.ExternalData/SHA"
   )

At build time a test named "example_setup_test" will be created.  Run this test
on the command line with ``ctest(1)`` to load the data onto the Android
device.

Module Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: android_add_test_data

  .. code-block:: cmake

    android_add_test_data(<test-name>
      [FILES <files>...] [FILES_DEST <device-dir>]
      [LIBS <libs>...]   [LIBS_DEST <device-dir>]
      [DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE <device-dir>]
      [DEVICE_TEST_DIR <device-dir>]
      [NO_LINK_REGEX <strings>...]
      )

  The ``android_add_test_data`` function is used to copy files and libraries
  needed to run project-specific tests. On the host operating system, this is
  done at build time. For on-device testing, the files are loaded onto the
  device by the manufactured test at run time.

  This function accepts the following named parameters:

  ``FILES <files>...``
    zero or more files needed for testing
  ``LIBS <libs>...``
    zero or more libraries needed for testing
  ``FILES_DEST <device-dir>``
    absolute path where the data files are expected to be
  ``LIBS_DEST <device-dir>``
    absolute path where the libraries are expected to be
  ``DEVICE_OBJECT_STORE <device-dir>``
    absolute path to the location where the data is stored on-device
  ``DEVICE_TEST_DIR <device-dir>``
    absolute path to the root directory of the on-device test location
  ``NO_LINK_REGEX <strings>...``
    list of regex strings matching the names of files that should be
    copied from the object store to the testing directory

BundleUtilities
---------------

Functions to help assemble a standalone bundle application.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with ``.app``
bundles on the Mac and bundle-like directories on any OS.

The following functions are provided by this module:

 fixup_bundle
 copy_and_fixup_bundle
 verify_app
 get_bundle_main_executable
 get_dotapp_dir
 get_bundle_and_executable
 get_bundle_all_executables
 get_item_key
 get_item_rpaths
 clear_bundle_keys
 set_bundle_key_values
 get_bundle_keys
 copy_resolved_item_into_bundle
 copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle
 fixup_bundle_item
 verify_bundle_prerequisites
 verify_bundle_symlinks

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break and
``PARENT_SCOPE``.  Also depends on ``GetPrerequisites.cmake``.

DO NOT USE THESE FUNCTIONS AT CONFIGURE TIME (from ``CMakeLists.txt``)!
Instead, invoke them from an ``install(CODE)`` or
``install(SCRIPT)`` rule.

 fixup_bundle(<app> <libs> <dirs>)

Fix up ``<app>`` bundle in-place and make it standalone, such that it can be
drag-n-drop copied to another machine and run on that machine as long
as all of the system libraries are compatible.

If you pass plugins to ``fixup_bundle`` as the libs parameter, you should
install them or copy them into the bundle before calling ``fixup_bundle``.
The ``<libs>`` parameter is a list of libraries that must be fixed up, but
that cannot be determined by ``otool`` output analysis  (i.e. ``plugins``).

Gather all the keys for all the executables and libraries in a bundle,
and then, for each key, copy each prerequisite into the bundle.  Then
fix each one up according to its own list of prerequisites.

Then clear all the keys and call ``verify_app`` on the final bundle to
ensure that it is truly standalone.

As an optional parameter (``IGNORE_ITEM``) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored
(e.g. ``IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"``).

 copy_and_fixup_bundle(<src> <dst> <libs> <dirs>)

Makes a copy of the bundle ``<src>`` at location ``<dst>`` and then fixes up
the new copied bundle in-place at ``<dst>``.

 verify_app(<app>)

Verifies that an application ``<app>`` appears valid based on running
analysis tools on it.  Calls ``message(FATAL_ERROR)`` if the application
is not verified.

As an optional parameter (``IGNORE_ITEM``) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored
(e.g. ``IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"``)

 get_bundle_main_executable(<bundle> <result_var>)

The result will be the full path name of the bundle's main executable
file or an ``error:`` prefixed string if it could not be determined.

 get_dotapp_dir(<exe> <dotapp_dir_var>)

Returns the nearest parent dir whose name ends with ``.app`` given the
full path to an executable.  If there is no such parent dir, then
simply return the dir containing the executable.

The returned directory may or may not exist.

 get_bundle_and_executable(<app> <bundle_var> <executable_var> <valid_var>)

Takes either a ``.app`` directory name or the name of an executable
nested inside a ``.app`` directory and returns the path to the ``.app``
directory in ``<bundle_var>`` and the path to its main executable in
``<executable_var>``.

 get_bundle_all_executables(<bundle> <exes_var>)

Scans ``<bundle>`` bundle recursively for all ``<exes_var>`` executable
files and accumulates them into a variable.

 get_item_key(<item> <key_var>)

Given ``<item>`` file name, generate ``<key_var>`` key that should be unique
considering the set of libraries that need copying or fixing up to
make a bundle standalone.  This is essentially the file name including
extension with ``.`` replaced by ``_``

This key is used as a prefix for CMake variables so that we can
associate a set of variables with a given item based on its key.

 clear_bundle_keys(<keys_var>)

Loop over the ``<keys_var>`` list of keys, clearing all the variables
associated with each key.  After the loop, clear the list of keys itself.

Caller of ``get_bundle_keys`` should call ``clear_bundle_keys`` when done with
list of keys.

 set_bundle_key_values(<keys_var> <context> <item> <exepath> <dirs>
                       <copyflag> [<rpaths>])

Add ``<keys_var>`` key to the list (if necessary) for the given item.
If added, also set all the variables associated with that key.

 get_bundle_keys(<app> <libs> <dirs> <keys_var>)

Loop over all the executable and library files within ``<app>`` bundle (and
given as extra ``<libs>``) and accumulate a list of keys representing
them.  Set values associated with each key such that we can loop over
all of them and copy prerequisite libs into the bundle and then do
appropriate ``install_name_tool`` fixups.

As an optional parameter (``IGNORE_ITEM``) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored
(e.g. ``IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"``)

 copy_resolved_item_into_bundle(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)

Copy a resolved item into the bundle if necessary.
Copy is not necessary, if the ``<resolved_item>`` is "the same as" the
``<resolved_embedded_item>``.

 copy_resolved_framework_into_bundle(<resolved_item> <resolved_embedded_item>)

Copy a resolved framework into the bundle if necessary.
Copy is not necessary, if the ``<resolved_item>`` is "the same as" the
``<resolved_embedded_item>``.

By default, ``BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS`` is not set.  If you want
full frameworks embedded in your bundles, set
``BU_COPY_FULL_FRAMEWORK_CONTENTS`` to ``ON`` before calling fixup_bundle.  By
default, ``COPY_RESOLVED_FRAMEWORK_INTO_BUNDLE`` copies the framework
dylib itself plus the framework ``Resources`` directory.

 fixup_bundle_item(<resolved_embedded_item> <exepath> <dirs>)

Get the direct/non-system prerequisites of the ``<resolved_embedded_item>``.
For each prerequisite, change the way it is referenced to the value of
the ``_EMBEDDED_ITEM`` keyed variable for that prerequisite.  (Most likely
changing to an ``@executable_path`` style reference.)

This function requires that the ``<resolved_embedded_item>`` be ``inside``
the bundle already.  In other words, if you pass plugins to ``fixup_bundle``
as the libs parameter, you should install them or copy them into the
bundle before calling ``fixup_bundle``.  The ``libs`` parameter is a list of
libraries that must be fixed up, but that cannot be determined by
otool output analysis.  (i.e., ``plugins``)

Also, change the id of the item being fixed up to its own
``_EMBEDDED_ITEM`` value.

Accumulate changes in a local variable and make *one* call to
``install_name_tool`` at the end of the function with all the changes at
once.

If the ``BU_CHMOD_BUNDLE_ITEMS`` variable is set then bundle items will be
marked writable before ``install_name_tool`` tries to change them.

 verify_bundle_prerequisites(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)

Verifies that the sum of all prerequisites of all files inside the
bundle are contained within the bundle or are ``system`` libraries,
presumed to exist everywhere.

As an optional parameter (``IGNORE_ITEM``) a list of file names can be passed,
which are then ignored
(e.g. ``IGNORE_ITEM "vcredist_x86.exe;vcredist_x64.exe"``)

 verify_bundle_symlinks(<bundle> <result_var> <info_var>)

Verifies that any symlinks found in the ``<bundle>`` bundle point to other files
that are already also in the bundle...  Anything that points to an
external file causes this function to fail the verification.

CheckCCompilerFlag
------------------

Check whether the C compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_c_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_c_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_c_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckCSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckCSourceCompiles
--------------------

Check if given C source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_c_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_c_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                            [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C source
  file and linked as an executable (so it must contain at least a ``main()``
  function). The result will be stored in the internal cache variable specified
  by ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean false
  for failure. If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by
  checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_c_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCSourceRuns
----------------

Check if given C source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_c_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_c_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>)

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must contain at
  least a ``main()`` function. If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_c_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCXXCompilerFlag
------------------------

Check whether the CXX compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_cxx_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_cxx_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckCXXSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckCXXSourceCompiles
----------------------

Check if given C++ source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_cxx_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                              [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C++ source
  file and linked as an executable (so it must contain at least a ``main()``
  function). The result will be stored in the internal cache variable specified
  by ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean false
  for failure. If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by
  checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached

  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCXXSourceRuns
------------------

Check if given C++ source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_cxx_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>)

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a C++ source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must contain at
  least a ``main()`` function. If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_cxx_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckCXXSymbolExists
--------------------

Check if a symbol exists as a function, variable, or macro in ``C++``.

.. command:: check_cxx_symbol_exists

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_cxx_symbol_exists(<symbol> <files> <variable>)

  Check that the ``<symbol>`` is available after including given header
  ``<files>`` and store the result in a ``<variable>``.  Specify the list of
  files in one argument as a semicolon-separated list.
  ``check_cxx_symbol_exists()`` can be used to check for symbols as seen by
  the C++ compiler, as opposed to ``check_symbol_exists()``, which always
  uses the ``C`` compiler.

  If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered
  available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol
  as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for
  linking.  If the symbol is a type, enum value, or C++ template it will
  not be recognized: consider using the ``CheckTypeSize``
  or ``CheckCXXSourceCompiles`` module instead.

.. note::

  This command is unreliable when ``<symbol>`` is (potentially) an overloaded
  function. Since there is no reliable way to predict whether a given function
  in the system environment may be defined as an overloaded function or may be
  an overloaded function on other systems or will become so in the future, it
  is generally advised to use the ``CheckCXXSourceCompiles`` module for
  checking any function symbol (unless somehow you surely know the checked
  function is not overloaded on other systems or will not be so in the
  future).

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

For example:

 include(CheckCXXSymbolExists)

 # Check for macro SEEK_SET
 check_cxx_symbol_exists(SEEK_SET "cstdio" HAVE_SEEK_SET)
 # Check for function std::fopen
 check_cxx_symbol_exists(std::fopen "cstdio" HAVE_STD_FOPEN)

CheckFortranCompilerFlag
------------------------

Check whether the Fortran compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_fortran_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_fortran_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckFortranSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckFortranFunctionExists
--------------------------

Check if a Fortran function exists.

.. command:: CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_FORTRAN_FUNCTION_EXISTS(<function> <result>)

  where

  ``<function>``
    the name of the Fortran function
  ``<result>``
    variable to store the result; will be created as an internal cache variable.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
  command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
  :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
  further details).

CheckFortranSourceCompiles
--------------------------

Check if given Fortran source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_fortran_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
        [FAIL_REGEX <regex>...]
        [SRC_EXT <extension>]
    )

  Checks that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Fortran
  source file and linked as an executable. The ``<code>`` must be a Fortran program
  containing at least an ``end`` statement--for example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_compiles("character :: b; error stop b; end" F2018ESTOPOK SRC_EXT F90)

  This command can help avoid costly build processes when a compiler lacks support
  for a necessary feature, or a particular vendor library is not compatible with
  the Fortran compiler version being used. This generate-time check may advise the
  user of such before the main build process. See also the
  ``check_fortran_source_runs()`` command to actually run the compiled code.

  The result will be stored in the internal cache
  variable ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean
  false for failure.

  If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by checking
  if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular expressions.

  By default, the test source file will be given a ``.F`` file extension. The
  ``SRC_EXT`` option can be used to override this with ``.<extension>`` instead--
  ``.F90`` is a typical choice.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_fortran_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckFortranSourceRuns
----------------------

Check if given Fortran source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_fortran_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>
        [SRC_EXT <extension>])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Fortran source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must be a Fortran program
  containing at least an ``end`` statement--for example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_fortran_source_runs("real :: x[*]; call co_sum(x); end" F2018coarrayOK)

  This command can help avoid costly build processes when a compiler lacks support
  for a necessary feature, or a particular vendor library is not compatible with
  the Fortran compiler version being used. Some of these failures only occur at runtime
  instead of linktime, and a trivial runtime example can catch the issue before the
  main build process.

  If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  By default, the test source file will be given a ``.F90`` file extension. The
  ``SRC_EXT`` option can be used to override this with ``.<extension>`` instead.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_fortran_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckFunctionExists
-------------------

Check if a C function can be linked

.. command:: check_function_exists

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_function_exists(<function> <variable>)

  Checks that the ``<function>`` is provided by libraries on the system and store
  the result in a ``<variable>``, which will be created as an internal
  cache variable.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify the
way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

.. note::

  Prefer using :Module:`CheckSymbolExists` instead of this module,
  for the following reasons:

  * ``check_function_exists()`` can't detect functions that are inlined
    in headers or specified as a macro.

  * ``check_function_exists()`` can't detect anything in the 32-bit
    versions of the Win32 API, because of a mismatch in calling conventions.

  * ``check_function_exists()`` only verifies linking, it does not verify
    that the function is declared in system headers.

CheckIPOSupported
-----------------

Check whether the compiler supports an interprocedural optimization (IPO/LTO).
Use this before enabling the ``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`` target
property.

.. command:: check_ipo_supported

  ::

   check_ipo_supported([RESULT <result>] [OUTPUT <output>]
                       [LANGUAGES <lang>...])

 Options are:

 ``RESULT <result>``
   Set ``<result>`` variable to ``YES`` if IPO is supported by the
   compiler and ``NO`` otherwise.  If this option is not given then
   the command will issue a fatal error if IPO is not supported.
 ``OUTPUT <output>``
   Set ``<output>`` variable with details about any error.
 ``LANGUAGES <lang>...``
   Specify languages whose compilers to check.
   Languages ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``Fortran`` are supported.

It makes no sense to use this module when ``CMP0069`` is set to ``OLD`` so
module will return error in this case. See policy ``CMP0069`` for details.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

 check_ipo_supported() # fatal error if IPO is not supported
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

 # Optional IPO. Do not use IPO if it's not supported by compiler.
 check_ipo_supported(RESULT result OUTPUT output)
 if(result)
   set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
 else()
   message(WARNING "IPO is not supported: ${output}")
 endif()

CheckIncludeFileCXX
-------------------

Provides a macro to check if a header file can be included in ``CXX``.

.. command:: CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE_CXX(<include> <variable> [<flags>])

  Check if the given ``<include>`` file may be included in a ``CXX``
  source file and store the result in an internal cache entry named
  ``<variable>``.  The optional third argument may be used to add
  compilation flags to the check (or use ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS`` below).

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

See modules ``CheckIncludeFile`` and ``CheckIncludeFiles``
to check for one or more ``C`` headers.

CheckIncludeFile
----------------

Provides a macro to check if a header file can be included in ``C``.

.. command:: CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_INCLUDE_FILE(<include> <variable> [<flags>])

  Check if the given ``<include>`` file may be included in a ``C``
  source file and store the result in an internal cache entry named
  ``<variable>``.  The optional third argument may be used to add
  compilation flags to the check (or use ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS`` below).

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

See the ``CheckIncludeFiles`` module to check for multiple headers
at once.  See the ``CheckIncludeFileCXX`` module to check for headers
using the ``CXX`` language.

CheckIncludeFiles
-----------------

Provides a macro to check if a list of one or more header files can
be included together.

.. command:: CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_INCLUDE_FILES("<includes>" <variable> [LANGUAGE <language>])

  Check if the given ``<includes>`` list may be included together
  in a source file and store the result in an internal cache
  entry named ``<variable>``.  Specify the ``<includes>`` argument
  as a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header file names.

  If ``LANGUAGE`` is set, the specified compiler will be used to perform the
  check. Acceptable values are ``C`` and ``CXX``. If not set, the C compiler
  will be used if enabled. If the C compiler is not enabled, the C++
  compiler will be used if enabled.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

See modules ``CheckIncludeFile`` and ``CheckIncludeFileCXX``
to check for a single header file in ``C`` or ``CXX`` languages.

CheckLanguage
-------------

Check if a language can be enabled

Usage:

::

 check_language(<lang>)

where ``<lang>`` is a language that may be passed to ``enable_language()``
such as ``Fortran``.  If ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`` is already defined
the check does nothing.  Otherwise it tries enabling the language in a
test project.  The result is cached in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER``
as the compiler that was found, or ``NOTFOUND`` if the language cannot be
enabled. For CUDA which can have an explicit host compiler, the cache
``CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER`` variable will be set if it was required
for compilation.

Example:

::

 check_language(Fortran)
 if(CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER)
   enable_language(Fortran)
 else()
   message(STATUS "No Fortran support")
 endif()

CheckLibraryExists
------------------

Check if the function exists.

.. command:: CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_LIBRARY_EXISTS(LIBRARY FUNCTION LOCATION VARIABLE)

  ::

 LIBRARY  - the name of the library you are looking for
 FUNCTION - the name of the function
 LOCATION - location where the library should be found
 VARIABLE - variable to store the result
            Will be created as an internal cache variable.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

CheckOBJCCompilerFlag
---------------------

Check whether the Objective-C compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_objc_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_objc_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_objc_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckOBJCSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_OBJC_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckOBJCSourceCompiles
-----------------------

Check if given Objective-C source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_objc_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_objc_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                               [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Objectie-C source
  file and linked as an executable (so it must contain at least a ``main()``
  function). The result will be stored in the internal cache variable specified
  by ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean false
  for failure. If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by
  checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_objc_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_OBJC_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckOBJCSourceRuns
-------------------

Check if given Objective-C source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_objc_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_objc_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>)

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Objective-C source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must contain at
  least a ``main()`` function. If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_objc_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_OBJC_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckOBJCXXCompilerFlag
-----------------------

Check whether the Objective-C++ compiler supports a given flag.

.. command:: check_objcxx_compiler_flag

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_objcxx_compiler_flag(<flag> <var>)

  Check that the ``<flag>`` is accepted by the compiler without
  a diagnostic.  Stores the result in an internal cache entry
  named ``<var>``.

This command temporarily sets the ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS`` variable
and calls the ``check_objcxx_source_compiles`` macro from the
``CheckOBJCXXSourceCompiles`` module.  See documentation of that
module for a listing of variables that can otherwise modify the build.

A positive result from this check indicates only that the compiler did not
issue a diagnostic message when given the flag.  Whether the flag has any
effect or even a specific one is beyond the scope of this module.

.. note::
  Since the ``try_compile()`` command forwards flags from variables
  like ``CMAKE_OBJCXX_FLAGS``, unknown flags
  in such variables may cause a false negative for this check.

CheckOBJCXXSourceCompiles
-------------------------

Check if given Objective-C++ source compiles and links into an executable.

.. command:: check_objcxx_source_compiles

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_objcxx_source_compiles(<code> <resultVar>
                                 [FAIL_REGEX <regex1> [<regex2>...]])

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Objective-C++ source
  file and linked as an executable (so it must contain at least a ``main()``
  function). The result will be stored in the internal cache variable specified
  by ``<resultVar>``, with a boolean true value for success and boolean false
  for failure. If ``FAIL_REGEX`` is provided, then failure is determined by
  checking if anything in the output matches any of the specified regular
  expressions.

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_compile()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_objcxx_source_compiles()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_OBJCXX_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_compile()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_compile()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_compile()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckOBJCXXSourceRuns
---------------------

Check if given Objective-C++ source compiles and links into an executable and can
subsequently be run.

.. command:: check_objcxx_source_runs

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_objcxx_source_runs(<code> <resultVar>)

  Check that the source supplied in ``<code>`` can be compiled as a Objective-C++ source
  file, linked as an executable and then run. The ``<code>`` must contain at
  least a ``main()`` function. If the ``<code>`` could be built and run
  successfully, the internal cache variable specified by ``<resultVar>`` will
  be set to 1, otherwise it will be set to an value that evaluates to boolean
  false (e.g. an empty string or an error message).

  The underlying check is performed by the ``try_run()`` command. The
  compile and link commands can be influenced by setting any of the following
  variables prior to calling ``check_objcxx_source_runs()``:

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
    Additional flags to pass to the compiler. Note that the contents of
    ``CMAKE_OBJCXX_FLAGS`` and its associated
    configuration-specific variable are automatically added to the compiler
    command before the contents of ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of compiler definitions of the form
    ``-DFOO`` or ``-DFOO=bar``. A definition for the name specified by
    ``<resultVar>`` will also be added automatically.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
    the compiler. These will be the only header search paths used by
    ``try_run()``, i.e. the contents of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
    directory property will be ignored.

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link
    command (see ``try_run()`` for further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
    A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
    command. These can be the name of system libraries or they can be
    :ref:`Imported Targets <Imported Targets>` (see ``try_run()`` for
    further details).

  ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
    If this variable evaluates to a boolean true value, all status messages
    associated with the check will be suppressed.

  The check is only performed once, with the result cached in the variable
  named by ``<resultVar>``. Every subsequent CMake run will re-use this cached
  value rather than performing the check again, even if the ``<code>`` changes.
  In order to force the check to be re-evaluated, the variable named by
  ``<resultVar>`` must be manually removed from the cache.


CheckPIESupported
-----------------

Check whether the linker supports Position Independent Code (PIE) or No
Position Independent Code (NO_PIE) for executables.
Use this to ensure that the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target
property for executables will be honored at link time.

.. command:: check_pie_supported

  ::

   check_pie_supported([OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output>]
                       [LANGUAGES <lang>...])

 Options are:

 ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <output>``
   Set ``<output>`` variable with details about any error.
 ``LANGUAGES <lang>...``
   Check the linkers used for each of the specified languages.
   Supported languages are ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``Fortran``.

It makes no sense to use this module when ``CMP0083`` is set to ``OLD``,
so the command will return an error in this case.  See policy ``CMP0083``
for details.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

For each language checked, two boolean cache variables are defined.

 ``CMAKE_<lang>_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED``
   Set to ``YES`` if ``PIE`` is supported by the linker and ``NO`` otherwise.
 ``CMAKE_<lang>_LINK_NO_PIE_SUPPORTED``
   Set to ``YES`` if ``NO_PIE`` is supported by the linker and ``NO`` otherwise.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

 check_pie_supported()
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)

 # Retrieve any error message.
 check_pie_supported(OUTPUT_VARIABLE output LANGUAGES C)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)
 if(NOT CMAKE_C_LINK_PIE_SUPPORTED)
   message(WARNING "PIE is not supported at link time: ${output}.\n"
                   "PIE link options will not be passed to linker.")
 endif()

CheckPrototypeDefinition
------------------------

Check if the prototype we expect is correct.

.. command:: check_prototype_definition

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_prototype_definition(FUNCTION PROTOTYPE RETURN HEADER VARIABLE)

  ::

   FUNCTION - The name of the function (used to check if prototype exists)
   PROTOTYPE- The prototype to check.
   RETURN - The return value of the function.
   HEADER - The header files required.
   VARIABLE - The variable to store the result.
              Will be created as an internal cache variable.

 Example:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   check_prototype_definition(getpwent_r
    "struct passwd *getpwent_r(struct passwd *src, char *buf, int buflen)"
    "NULL"
    "unistd.h;pwd.h"
    SOLARIS_GETPWENT_R)

The following variables may be set before calling this function to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

CheckStructHasMember
--------------------

Check if the given struct or class has the specified member variable

.. command:: CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER(<struct> <member> <header> <variable>
                            [LANGUAGE <language>])

  ::

 <struct> - the name of the struct or class you are interested in
 <member> - the member which existence you want to check
 <header> - the header(s) where the prototype should be declared
 <variable> - variable to store the result
 <language> - the compiler to use (C or CXX)

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

Example:

 CHECK_STRUCT_HAS_MEMBER("struct timeval" tv_sec sys/select.h
                         HAVE_TIMEVAL_TV_SEC LANGUAGE C)

CheckSymbolExists
-----------------

Provides a macro to check if a symbol exists as a function, variable,
or macro in ``C``.

.. command:: check_symbol_exists

  .. code-block:: cmake

    check_symbol_exists(<symbol> <files> <variable>)

  Check that the ``<symbol>`` is available after including given header
  ``<files>`` and store the result in a ``<variable>``.  Specify the list
  of files in one argument as a semicolon-separated list.
  ``<variable>`` will be created as an internal cache variable.

If the header files define the symbol as a macro it is considered
available and assumed to work.  If the header files declare the symbol
as a function or variable then the symbol must also be available for
linking (so intrinsics may not be detected).
If the symbol is a type, enum value, or intrinsic it will not be recognized
(consider using ``CheckTypeSize`` or ``CheckCSourceCompiles``).
If the check needs to be done in C++, consider using
``CheckCXXSymbolExists`` instead.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``
  string of compile command line flags.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of macros to define (-DFOO=bar).
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of header search paths to pass to
  the compiler.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of options to add to the link command.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
  a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries to add to the link
  command. See policy ``CMP0075``.
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET``
  execute quietly without messages.

For example:

 include(CheckSymbolExists)

 # Check for macro SEEK_SET
 check_symbol_exists(SEEK_SET "stdio.h" HAVE_SEEK_SET)
 # Check for function fopen
 check_symbol_exists(fopen "stdio.h" HAVE_FOPEN)

CheckTypeSize
-------------

Check sizeof a type

.. command:: CHECK_TYPE_SIZE

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_TYPE_SIZE(TYPE VARIABLE [BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY]
                                  [LANGUAGE <language>])

  Check if the type exists and determine its size.  On return,
  ``HAVE_${VARIABLE}`` holds the existence of the type, and ``${VARIABLE}``
  holds one of the following:

  ::

    <size> = type has non-zero size <size>
    "0"    = type has arch-dependent size (see below)
    ""     = type does not exist

 Both ``HAVE_${VARIABLE}`` and ``${VARIABLE}`` will be created as internal
 cache variables.

 Furthermore, the variable ``${VARIABLE}_CODE`` holds C preprocessor code
 to define the macro ``${VARIABLE}`` to the size of the type, or leave
 the macro undefined if the type does not exist.

 The variable ``${VARIABLE}`` may be ``0`` when
 :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES` has multiple architectures for building
 OS X universal binaries.  This indicates that the type size varies across
 architectures.  In this case ``${VARIABLE}_CODE`` contains C preprocessor
 tests mapping from each architecture macro to the corresponding type size.
 The list of architecture macros is stored in ``${VARIABLE}_KEYS``, and the
 value for each key is stored in ``${VARIABLE}-${KEY}``.

 If the ``BUILTIN_TYPES_ONLY`` option is not given, the macro checks for
 headers ``<sys/types.h>``, ``<stdint.h>``, and ``<stddef.h>``, and saves
 results in ``HAVE_SYS_TYPES_H``, ``HAVE_STDINT_H``, and ``HAVE_STDDEF_H``.
 The type size check automatically includes the available headers, thus
 supporting checks of types defined in the headers.

 If ``LANGUAGE`` is set, the specified compiler will be used to perform the
 check. Acceptable values are ``C`` and ``CXX``.

Despite the name of the macro you may use it to check the size of more
complex expressions, too.  To check e.g.  for the size of a struct
member you can do something like this:

 check_type_size("((struct something*)0)->member" SIZEOF_MEMBER)

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES = list of include directories
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS  = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages
 CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES = list of extra headers to include

CheckVariableExists
-------------------

Check if the variable exists.

.. command:: CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS

  .. code-block:: cmake

    CHECK_VARIABLE_EXISTS(VAR VARIABLE)


  ::

   VAR      - the name of the variable
   VARIABLE - variable to store the result
              Will be created as an internal cache variable.


 This macro is only for ``C`` variables.

The following variables may be set before calling this macro to modify
the way the check is run:

::

 CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS = string of compile command line flags
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS = list of macros to define (-DFOO=bar)
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS = list of options to pass to link command
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES = list of libraries to link
 CMAKE_REQUIRED_QUIET = execute quietly without messages

CMakeAddFortranSubdirectory
---------------------------

Add a fortran-only subdirectory, find a fortran compiler, and build.

The ``cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory`` function adds a subdirectory
to a project that contains a fortran-only subproject.  The module will
check the current compiler and see if it can support fortran.  If no
fortran compiler is found and the compiler is MSVC, then this module
will find the MinGW gfortran.  It will then use an external project to
build with the MinGW tools.  It will also create imported targets for
the libraries created.  This will only work if the fortran code is
built into a dll, so ``BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` is turned on in
the project.  In addition the ``CMAKE_GNUtoMS`` option is set
to on, so that Microsoft ``.lib`` files are created.  Usage is as follows:

::

 cmake_add_fortran_subdirectory(
  <subdir>                # name of subdirectory
  PROJECT <project_name>  # project name in subdir top CMakeLists.txt
  ARCHIVE_DIR <dir>       # dir where project places .lib files
  RUNTIME_DIR <dir>       # dir where project places .dll files
  LIBRARIES <lib>...      # names of library targets to import
  LINK_LIBRARIES          # link interface libraries for LIBRARIES
   [LINK_LIBS <lib> <dep>...]...
  CMAKE_COMMAND_LINE ...  # extra command line flags to pass to cmake
  NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL     # skip installation of external project
  )

Relative paths in ``ARCHIVE_DIR`` and ``RUNTIME_DIR`` are interpreted with
respect to the build directory corresponding to the source directory
in which the function is invoked.

Limitations:

``NO_EXTERNAL_INSTALL`` is required for forward compatibility with a
future version that supports installation of the external project
binaries during ``make install``.

CMakeBackwardCompatibilityCXX
-----------------------------

define a bunch of backwards compatibility variables

::

 CMAKE_ANSI_CXXFLAGS - flag for ansi c++
 CMAKE_HAS_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - has <strstream>
 include(TestForANSIStreamHeaders)
 include(CheckIncludeFileCXX)
 include(TestForSTDNamespace)
 include(TestForANSIForScope)

CMakeDependentOption
--------------------

Macro to provide an option dependent on other options.

This macro presents an option to the user only if a set of other
conditions are true.  When the option is not presented a default value
is used, but any value set by the user is preserved for when the
option is presented again.  Example invocation:

 CMAKE_DEPENDENT_OPTION(USE_FOO "Use Foo" ON
                        "USE_BAR;NOT USE_ZOT" OFF)

If USE_BAR is true and USE_ZOT is false, this provides an option
called USE_FOO that defaults to ON.  Otherwise, it sets USE_FOO to
OFF.  If the status of USE_BAR or USE_ZOT ever changes, any value for
the USE_FOO option is saved so that when the option is re-enabled it
retains its old value.  Each element in the fourth parameter is
evaluated as an if-condition, so :ref:`Condition Syntax` can be used.

CMakeFindDependencyMacro
-------------------------

.. command:: find_dependency

  The ``find_dependency()`` macro wraps a ``find_package()`` call for
  a package dependency::

   find_dependency(<dep> [...])

 It is designed to be used in a
 :ref:`Package Configuration File <Config File Packages>`
 (``<PackageName>Config.cmake``).  ``find_dependency`` forwards the correct
 parameters for ``QUIET`` and ``REQUIRED`` which were passed to
 the original :command:`find_package` call.  Any additional arguments
 specified are forwarded to :command:`find_package`.

 If the dependency could not be found it sets an informative diagnostic
 message and calls :command:`return` to end processing of the calling
 package configuration file and return to the :command:`find_package`
 command that loaded it.

 .. note::

   The call to :command:`return` makes this macro unsuitable to call
   from :ref:`Find Modules`.

CMakeFindFrameworks
-------------------

helper module to find OSX frameworks

This module reads hints about search locations from variables::

 CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK_EXTRA_LOCATIONS - Extra directories

CMakeFindPackageMode
--------------------



This file is executed by cmake when invoked with --find-package.  It
expects that the following variables are set using -D:

``NAME``
  name of the package
``COMPILER_ID``
  the CMake compiler ID for which the result is,
  i.e. GNU/Intel/Clang/MSVC, etc.
``LANGUAGE``
  language for which the result will be used,
  i.e. C/CXX/Fortran/ASM
``MODE``
  ``EXIST``
    only check for existence of the given package
  ``COMPILE``
    print the flags needed for compiling an object file which uses
    the given package
  ``LINK``
    print the flags needed for linking when using the given package
``QUIET``
  if TRUE, don't print anything

CMakeGraphVizOptions
--------------------

The builtin graphviz support of CMake.

Variables specific to the graphviz support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

CMake
can generate graphviz files, showing the dependencies between the
targets in a project and also external libraries which are linked
against.  When CMake is run with the ``--graphviz=foo.dot`` option, it will
produce:

* a ``foo.dot`` file showing all dependencies in the project
* a ``foo.dot.<target>`` file for each target, file showing on which other targets the respective target depends
* a ``foo.dot.<target>.dependers`` file, showing which other targets depend on the respective target

The different dependency types ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE`` and ``INTERFACE``
are represented as solid, dashed and dotted edges.

This can result in huge graphs.  Using the file
``CMakeGraphVizOptions.cmake`` the look and content of the generated
graphs can be influenced.  This file is searched first in
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`` and then in ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``.  If found, it is
read and the variables set in it are used to adjust options for the
generated graphviz files.

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_TYPE

 The graph type.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : "digraph"

 Valid graph types are:

 * "graph" : Nodes are joined with lines
 * "digraph" : Nodes are joined with arrows showing direction
 * "strict graph" : Like "graph" but max one line between each node
 * "strict digraph" : Like "graph" but max one line between each node in each direction

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_NAME

 The graph name.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : "GG"

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_GRAPH_HEADER

 The header written at the top of the graphviz file.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : "node [n  fontsize = "12"];"

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_NODE_PREFIX

 The prefix for each node in the graphviz file.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : "node"

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_EXECUTABLES

 Set this to FALSE to exclude executables from the generated graphs.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_STATIC_LIBS

 Set this to FALSE to exclude static libraries from the generated graphs.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_SHARED_LIBS

 Set this to FALSE to exclude shared libraries from the generated graphs.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_MODULE_LIBS

 Set this to FALSE to exclude module libraries from the generated graphs.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_EXTERNAL_LIBS

 Set this to FALSE to exclude external libraries from the generated graphs.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_IGNORE_TARGETS

 A list of regular expressions for ignoring targets.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : empty

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_GENERATE_PER_TARGET

 Set this to FALSE to exclude per target graphs ``foo.dot.<target>``.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

.. variable:: GRAPHVIZ_GENERATE_DEPENDERS

 Set this to FALSE to exclude depender graphs ``foo.dot.<target>.dependers``.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : TRUE

CMakePackageConfigHelpers
-------------------------

Helpers functions for creating config files that can be included by other
projects to find and use a package.

Adds the ``configure_package_config_file()`` and
``write_basic_package_version_file()`` commands.

Generating a Package Configuration File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: configure_package_config_file

 Create a config file for a project::

 configure_package_config_file(<input> <output>
   INSTALL_DESTINATION <path>
   [PATH_VARS <var1> <var2> ... <varN>]
   [NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO]
   [NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO]
   [INSTALL_PREFIX <path>]
   )

``configure_package_config_file()`` should be used instead of the plain
``configure_file()`` command when creating the ``<PackageName>Config.cmake``
or ``<PackageName>-config.cmake`` file for installing a project or library.
It helps making the resulting package relocatable by avoiding hardcoded paths
in the installed ``Config.cmake`` file.

In a ``FooConfig.cmake`` file there may be code like this to make the install
destinations know to the using project:

 set(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_INCLUDEDIR@" )
 set(FOO_DATA_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/@RELATIVE_DATA_INSTALL_DIR@" )
 set(FOO_ICONS_DIR   "@CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX@/share/icons" )
 #...logic to determine installedPrefix from the own location...
 set(FOO_CONFIG_DIR  "${installedPrefix}/@CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@" )

All 4 options shown above are not sufficient, since the first 3 hardcode the
absolute directory locations, and the 4th case works only if the logic to
determine the ``installedPrefix`` is correct, and if ``CONFIG_INSTALL_DIR``
contains a relative path, which in general cannot be guaranteed.  This has the
effect that the resulting ``FooConfig.cmake`` file would work poorly under
Windows and OSX, where users are used to choose the install location of a
binary package at install time, independent from how
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` was set at build/cmake time.

Using ``configure_package_config_file`` helps.  If used correctly, it makes
the resulting ``FooConfig.cmake`` file relocatable.  Usage:

1. write a ``FooConfig.cmake.in`` file as you are used to
2. insert a line containing only the string ``@PACKAGE_INIT@``
3. instead of ``set(FOO_DIR "@SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")``, use
   ``set(FOO_DIR "@PACKAGE_SOME_INSTALL_DIR@")`` (this must be after the
   ``@PACKAGE_INIT@`` line)
4. instead of using the normal ``configure_file()``, use
   ``configure_package_config_file()``



The ``<input>`` and ``<output>`` arguments are the input and output file, the
same way as in ``configure_file()``.

The ``<path>`` given to ``INSTALL_DESTINATION`` must be the destination where
the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file will be installed to.  This path can either be
absolute, or relative to the ``INSTALL_PREFIX`` path.

The variables ``<var1>`` to ``<varN>`` given as ``PATH_VARS`` are the
variables which contain install destinations.  For each of them the macro will
create a helper variable ``PACKAGE_<var...>``.  These helper variables must be
used in the ``FooConfig.cmake.in`` file for setting the installed location.
They are calculated by ``configure_package_config_file`` so that they are
always relative to the installed location of the package.  This works both for
relative and also for absolute locations.  For absolute locations it works
only if the absolute location is a subdirectory of ``INSTALL_PREFIX``.

If the ``INSTALL_PREFIX`` argument is passed, this is used as base path to
calculate all the relative paths.  The ``<path>`` argument must be an absolute
path.  If this argument is not passed, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``
variable will be used instead.  The default value is good when generating a
FooConfig.cmake file to use your package from the install tree.  When
generating a FooConfig.cmake file to use your package from the build tree this
option should be used.

By default ``configure_package_config_file`` also generates two helper macros,
``set_and_check()`` and ``check_required_components()`` into the
``FooConfig.cmake`` file.

``set_and_check()`` should be used instead of the normal ``set()`` command for
setting directories and file locations.  Additionally to setting the variable
it also checks that the referenced file or directory actually exists and fails
with a ``FATAL_ERROR`` otherwise.  This makes sure that the created
``FooConfig.cmake`` file does not contain wrong references.
When using the ``NO_SET_AND_CHECK_MACRO``, this macro is not generated
into the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file.

``check_required_components(<PackageName>)`` should be called at the end of
the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file. This macro checks whether all requested,
non-optional components have been found, and if this is not the case, sets
the ``Foo_FOUND`` variable to ``FALSE``, so that the package is considered to
be not found.  It does that by testing the ``Foo_<Component>_FOUND``
variables for all requested required components.  This macro should be
called even if the package doesn't provide any components to make sure
users are not specifying components erroneously.  When using the
``NO_CHECK_REQUIRED_COMPONENTS_MACRO`` option, this macro is not generated
into the ``FooConfig.cmake`` file.

For an example see below the documentation for
``write_basic_package_version_file()``.

Generating a Package Version File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: write_basic_package_version_file

 Create a version file for a project::

 write_basic_package_version_file(<filename>
   [VERSION <major.minor.patch>]
   COMPATIBILITY <AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|SameMinorVersion|ExactVersion>
   [ARCH_INDEPENDENT] )

Writes a file for use as ``<PackageName>ConfigVersion.cmake`` file to
``<filename>``.  See the documentation of ``find_package()`` for
details on this.

``<filename>`` is the output filename, it should be in the build tree.
``<major.minor.patch>`` is the version number of the project to be installed.

If no ``VERSION`` is given, the ``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable is used.
If this hasn't been set, it errors out.

The ``COMPATIBILITY`` mode ``AnyNewerVersion`` means that the installed
package version will be considered compatible if it is newer or exactly the
same as the requested version.  This mode should be used for packages which
are fully backward compatible, also across major versions.
If ``SameMajorVersion`` is used instead, then the behaviour differs from
``AnyNewerVersion`` in that the major version number must be the same as
requested, e.g.  version 2.0 will not be considered compatible if 1.0 is
requested.  This mode should be used for packages which guarantee backward
compatibility within the same major version.
If ``SameMinorVersion`` is used, the behaviour is the same as
``SameMajorVersion``, but both major and minor version must be the same as
requested, e.g version 0.2 will not be compatible if 0.1 is requested.
If ``ExactVersion`` is used, then the package is only considered compatible if
the requested version matches exactly its own version number (not considering
the tweak version).  For example, version 1.2.3 of a package is only
considered compatible to requested version 1.2.3.  This mode is for packages
without compatibility guarantees.
If your project has more elaborated version matching rules, you will need to
write your own custom ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` file instead of using this
macro.

If ``ARCH_INDEPENDENT`` is given, the installed package version will be
considered compatible even if it was built for a different architecture than
the requested architecture.  Otherwise, an architecture check will be performed,
and the package will be considered compatible only if the architecture matches
exactly.  For example, if the package is built for a 32-bit architecture, the
package is only considered compatible if it is used on a 32-bit architecture,
unless ``ARCH_INDEPENDENT`` is given, in which case the package is considered
compatible on any architecture.

.. note:: ``ARCH_INDEPENDENT`` is intended for header-only libraries or similar
   packages with no binaries.

Internally, this macro executes ``configure_file()`` to create the
resulting version file.  Depending on the ``COMPATIBILITY``, the corresponding
``BasicConfigVersion-<COMPATIBILITY>.cmake.in`` file is used.
Please note that these files are internal to CMake and you should not call
``configure_file()`` on them yourself, but they can be used as starting
point to create more sophisticted custom ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` files.

Example Generating Package Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Example using both ``configure_package_config_file()`` and
``write_basic_package_version_file()``:

``CMakeLists.txt``:

 set(INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR include/ ... CACHE )
 set(LIB_INSTALL_DIR lib/ ... CACHE )
 set(SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR etc/foo/ ... CACHE )
 #...
 include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
 configure_package_config_file(FooConfig.cmake.in
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
   INSTALL_DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake
   PATH_VARS INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR)
 write_basic_package_version_file(
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
   VERSION 1.2.3
   COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion )
 install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfig.cmake
               ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/FooConfigVersion.cmake
         DESTINATION ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/Foo/cmake )

``FooConfig.cmake.in``:

::

 set(FOO_VERSION x.y.z)
 ...
 @PACKAGE_INIT@
 ...
 set_and_check(FOO_INCLUDE_DIR "@PACKAGE_INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR@")
 set_and_check(FOO_SYSCONFIG_DIR "@PACKAGE_SYSCONFIG_INSTALL_DIR@")

 check_required_components(Foo)

CMakePrintHelpers
-----------------

Convenience functions for printing properties and variables, useful
e.g. for debugging.

::

 cmake_print_properties([TARGETS target1 ..  targetN]
                       [SOURCES source1 .. sourceN]
                       [DIRECTORIES dir1 .. dirN]
                       [TESTS test1 .. testN]
                       [CACHE_ENTRIES entry1 .. entryN]
                       PROPERTIES prop1 .. propN )

This function prints the values of the properties of the given targets,
source files, directories, tests or cache entries.  Exactly one of the
scope keywords must be used.  Example::

 cmake_print_properties(TARGETS foo bar PROPERTIES
                        LOCATION INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES)

This will print the LOCATION and INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES properties for
both targets foo and bar.

::

 cmake_print_variables(var1 var2 ..  varN)

This function will print the name of each variable followed by its value.
Example::

 cmake_print_variables(CMAKE_C_COMPILER CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION DOES_NOT_EXIST)

Gives::

 -- CMAKE_C_COMPILER="/usr/bin/gcc" ; CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION="2" ; DOES_NOT_EXIST=""

CMakePrintSystemInformation
---------------------------

print system information

This file can be used for diagnostic purposes just include it in a
project to see various internal CMake variables.

CMakePushCheckState
-------------------



This module defines three macros: ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()``
``CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE()`` and ``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` These macros can
be used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents) the state of
the variables ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``,
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``,
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES`` and ``CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES`` used by the
various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g. ``check_function_exists()``
etc.
The variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is
supported.  This is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module,
where they have to be set, but after the Find-module has been executed they
should have the same value as they had before.

``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` macro receives optional argument ``RESET``.
Whether it's specified, ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` will set all
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_*`` variables to empty values, same as
``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` call will do.

Usage:

 cmake_push_check_state(RESET)
 set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DSOME_MORE_DEF)
 check_function_exists(...)
 cmake_reset_check_state()
 set(CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS -DANOTHER_DEF)
 check_function_exists(...)
 cmake_pop_check_state()

CMakeVerifyManifest
-------------------



CMakeVerifyManifest.cmake

This script is used to verify that embedded manifests and side by side
manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd to a directory
and run the script with cmake -P.  On the command line you can pass in
versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files.  For
example, cmake -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0
-PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embedded manifest
of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not
found in the .manifest file.

CPackComponent
--------------

Build binary and source package installers

Variables concerning CPack Components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPackComponent module is the module which handles the component
part of CPack.  See CPack module for general information about CPack.

For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical
installers on macOS and Windows), CPack generates installers that
allow users to select individual application components to install.
The contents of each of the components are identified by the COMPONENT
argument of CMake's INSTALL command.  These components can be
annotated with user-friendly names and descriptions, inter-component
dependencies, etc., and grouped in various ways to customize the
resulting installer.  See the cpack_add_* commands, described below,
for more information about component-specific installations.

Component-specific installation allows users to select specific sets
of components to install during the install process.  Installation
components are identified by the COMPONENT argument of CMake's INSTALL
commands, and should be further described by the following CPack
commands:

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL

 The list of component to install.

 The default value of this variable is computed by CPack and contains all
 components defined by the project.  The user may set it to only include the
 specified components.

 Instead of specifying all the desired components, it is possible to obtain a
 list of all defined components and then remove the unwanted ones from the
 list. The ``get_cmake_property()`` command can be used to obtain the
 ``COMPONENTS`` property, then the ``list(REMOVE_ITEM)`` command can be
 used to remove the unwanted ones. For example, to use all defined components
 except ``foo`` and ``bar``::

 get_cmake_property(CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL COMPONENTS)
 list(REMOVE_ITEM CPACK_COMPONENTS_ALL "foo" "bar")

.. variable:: CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL

 Enable/Disable component install for CPack generator <GENNAME>.

 Each CPack Generator (RPM, DEB, ARCHIVE, NSIS, DMG, etc...) has a legacy
 default behavior.  e.g.  RPM builds monolithic whereas NSIS builds
 component.  One can change the default behavior by setting this variable to
 0/1 or OFF/ON.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING

 Specify how components are grouped for multi-package component-aware CPack
 generators.

 Some generators like RPM or ARCHIVE family (TGZ, ZIP, ...) generates
 several packages files when asked for component packaging.  They group
 the component differently depending on the value of this variable:

 * ONE_PER_GROUP (default): creates one package file per component group
 * ALL_COMPONENTS_IN_ONE : creates a single package with all (requested) components
 * IGNORE : creates one package per component, i.e. IGNORE component group

 One can specify different grouping for different CPack generator by
 using a CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISPLAY_NAME

 The name to be displayed for a component.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION

 The description of a component.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_GROUP

 The group of a component.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DEPENDS

 The dependencies (list of components) on which this component depends.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_HIDDEN

 True if this component is hidden from the user.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_REQUIRED

 True if this component is required.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISABLED

 True if this component is not selected to be installed by default.

.. command:: cpack_add_component

Describes a CPack installation
component named by the COMPONENT argument to a CMake INSTALL command.

::

 cpack_add_component(compname
                     [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                     [DESCRIPTION description]
                     [HIDDEN | REQUIRED | DISABLED ]
                     [GROUP group]
                     [DEPENDS comp1 comp2 ... ]
                     [INSTALL_TYPES type1 type2 ... ]
                     [DOWNLOADED]
                     [ARCHIVE_FILE filename]
                     [PLIST filename])

The cmake_add_component command describes an installation component,
which the user can opt to install or remove as part of the graphical
installation process.  compname is the name of the component, as
provided to the COMPONENT argument of one or more CMake INSTALL
commands.

DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component, used in graphical
installers to display the component name.  This value can be any
string.

DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component, used in
graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
component.  Descriptions can span multiple lines using ``\n`` as the
line separator.  Typically, these descriptions should be no more than
a few lines long.

HIDDEN indicates that this component will be hidden in the graphical
installer, so that the user cannot directly change whether it is
installed or not.

REQUIRED indicates that this component is required, and therefore will
always be installed.  It will be visible in the graphical installer,
but it cannot be unselected.  (Typically, required components are
shown greyed out).

DISABLED indicates that this component should be disabled (unselected)
by default.  The user is free to select this component for
installation, unless it is also HIDDEN.

DEPENDS lists the components on which this component depends.  If this
component is selected, then each of the components listed must also be
selected.  The dependency information is encoded within the installer
itself, so that users cannot install inconsistent sets of components.

GROUP names the component group of which this component is a part.  If
not provided, the component will be a standalone component, not part
of any component group.  Component groups are described with the
cpack_add_component_group command, detailed below.

INSTALL_TYPES lists the installation types of which this component is
a part.  When one of these installations types is selected, this
component will automatically be selected.  Installation types are
described with the cpack_add_install_type command, detailed below.

DOWNLOADED indicates that this component should be downloaded
on-the-fly by the installer, rather than packaged in with the
installer itself.  For more information, see the
cpack_configure_downloads command.

ARCHIVE_FILE provides a name for the archive file created by CPack to
be used for downloaded components.  If not supplied, CPack will create
a file with some name based on CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME and the name of
the component.  See cpack_configure_downloads for more information.

PLIST gives a filename that is passed to pkgbuild with the
``--component-plist`` argument when using the productbuild generator.

.. command:: cpack_add_component_group

Describes a group of related CPack installation components.

::

 cpack_add_component_group(groupname
                          [DISPLAY_NAME name]
                          [DESCRIPTION description]
                          [PARENT_GROUP parent]
                          [EXPANDED]
                          [BOLD_TITLE])

The cpack_add_component_group describes a group of installation
components, which will be placed together within the listing of
options.  Typically, component groups allow the user to
select/deselect all of the components within a single group via a
single group-level option.  Use component groups to reduce the
complexity of installers with many options.  groupname is an arbitrary
name used to identify the group in the GROUP argument of the
cpack_add_component command, which is used to place a component in a
group.  The name of the group must not conflict with the name of any
component.

DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the component group, used in
graphical installers to display the component group name.  This value
can be any string.

DESCRIPTION is an extended description of the component group, used in
graphical installers to give the user additional information about the
components within that group.  Descriptions can span multiple lines
using ``\n`` as the line separator.  Typically, these descriptions
should be no more than a few lines long.

PARENT_GROUP, if supplied, names the parent group of this group.
Parent groups are used to establish a hierarchy of groups, providing
an arbitrary hierarchy of groups.

EXPANDED indicates that, by default, the group should show up as
"expanded", so that the user immediately sees all of the components
within the group.  Otherwise, the group will initially show up as a
single entry.

BOLD_TITLE indicates that the group title should appear in bold, to
call the user's attention to the group.

.. command:: cpack_add_install_type

Add a new installation type containing
a set of predefined component selections to the graphical installer.

::

 cpack_add_install_type(typename
                        [DISPLAY_NAME name])

The cpack_add_install_type command identifies a set of preselected
components that represents a common use case for an application.  For
example, a "Developer" install type might include an application along
with its header and library files, while an "End user" install type
might just include the application's executable.  Each component
identifies itself with one or more install types via the INSTALL_TYPES
argument to cpack_add_component.

DISPLAY_NAME is the displayed name of the install type, which will
typically show up in a drop-down box within a graphical installer.
This value can be any string.

.. command:: cpack_configure_downloads

Configure CPack to download
selected components on-the-fly as part of the installation process.

::

 cpack_configure_downloads(site
                           [UPLOAD_DIRECTORY dirname]
                           [ALL]
                           [ADD_REMOVE|NO_ADD_REMOVE])

The cpack_configure_downloads command configures installation-time
downloads of selected components.  For each downloadable component,
CPack will create an archive containing the contents of that
component, which should be uploaded to the given site.  When the user
selects that component for installation, the installer will download
and extract the component in place.  This feature is useful for
creating small installers that only download the requested components,
saving bandwidth.  Additionally, the installers are small enough that
they will be installed as part of the normal installation process, and
the "Change" button in Windows Add/Remove Programs control panel will
allow one to add or remove parts of the application after the original
installation.  On Windows, the downloaded-components functionality
requires the ZipDLL plug-in for NSIS, available at:

::

 http://nsis.sourceforge.net/ZipDLL_plug-in

On macOS, installers that download components on-the-fly can only
be built and installed on system using macOS 10.5 or later.

The site argument is a URL where the archives for downloadable
components will reside, e.g.,
https://cmake.org/files/2.6.1/installer/ All of the archives
produced by CPack should be uploaded to that location.

UPLOAD_DIRECTORY is the local directory where CPack will create the
various archives for each of the components.  The contents of this
directory should be uploaded to a location accessible by the URL given
in the site argument.  If omitted, CPack will use the directory
CPackUploads inside the CMake binary directory to store the generated
archives.

The ALL flag indicates that all components be downloaded.  Otherwise,
only those components explicitly marked as DOWNLOADED or that have a
specified ARCHIVE_FILE will be downloaded.  Additionally, the ALL
option implies ADD_REMOVE (unless NO_ADD_REMOVE is specified).

ADD_REMOVE indicates that CPack should install a copy of the installer
that can be called from Windows' Add/Remove Programs dialog (via the
"Modify" button) to change the set of installed components.
NO_ADD_REMOVE turns off this behavior.  This option is ignored on Mac
OS X.

CPackIFW
--------

The documentation for the CPack IFW generator has moved here: ``CPack IFW Generator``

This module looks for the location of the command line utilities supplied
with the Qt Installer Framework (QtIFW_).

The module also defines several commands to control the behavior of the
CPack ``IFW`` generator.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

The module defines the following commands:

.. command:: cpack_ifw_configure_component

  Sets the arguments specific to the CPack IFW generator.

  ::

CPackIFWConfigureFile
---------------------

The module defines ``configure_file()`` similar command to
configure file templates prepared in QtIFW/SDK/Creator style.


Commands
^^^^^^^^

The module defines the following commands:

.. command:: cpack_ifw_configure_file

  Copy a file to another location and modify its contents.

  ::

   cpack_ifw_configure_file(<input> <output>)

 Copies an ``<input>`` file to an ``<output>`` file and substitutes variable
 values referenced as ``%{VAR}`` or ``%VAR%`` in the input file content.
 Each variable reference will be replaced with the current value of the
 variable, or the empty string if the variable is not defined.

CPack
-----

Build binary and source package installers.

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack module generates a file ``CPackConfig.cmake`` intended for
use in a subsequent run of  the ``cpack`` program
where it steers the generation of installers or/and source packages.

Inclusion of the CPack module adds two new build targets, ``package``
and ``package_source``, which build the binary and source installers
respectively.  The generated binary installers contain everything
installed via CMake's ``install()`` command (and the deprecated
commands ``install_files()``, ``install_programs()``, and
``install_targets()``).

For certain kinds of binary installers (including the graphical
installers on macOS and Windows), CPack generates installers that
allow users to select individual application components to install.
See ``CPackComponent`` module for further details.

CPack Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` variable has different meanings in different
contexts.  In a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` is a
*list of generators*: and when ``cpack`` is run with no other
arguments, it will iterate over that list and produce one package for each
generator.  In a ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``,
``CPACK_GENERATOR`` is a *string naming a single generator*.  If you
need per-cpack-generator logic to control *other* cpack settings, then you
need a ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``.

The CMake source tree itself contains a ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``.
See the top level file ``CMakeCPackOptions.cmake.in`` for an example.

If set, the ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE`` is included automatically
on a per-generator basis.  It only need contain overrides.

Here's how it works:

* ``cpack`` runs
* it includes ``CPackConfig.cmake``
* it iterates over the generators given by the ``-G`` command line option,
  or if no such option was specified, over the list of generators given by
  the ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` variable set in the ``CPackConfig.cmake``
  input file.
* foreach generator, it then

  - sets ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` to the one currently being iterated
  - includes the ``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``
  - produces the package for that generator

This is the key: For each generator listed in ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` in
``CPackConfig.cmake``, cpack will *reset* ``CPACK_GENERATOR``
internally to *the one currently being used* and then include the
``CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE``.

Variables common to all CPack Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Before including this CPack module in your ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, there
are a variety of variables that can be set to customize the resulting
installers.  The most commonly-used variables are:

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

  The name of the package (or application).  If not specified, it defaults to
  the project name.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VENDOR

  The name of the package vendor. (e.g., "Kitware").  The default is "Humanity".

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DIRECTORY

  The directory in which CPack is doing its packaging.  If it is not set
  then this will default (internally) to the build dir.  This variable may
  be defined in a CPack config file or from the ``cpack``
  command line option ``-B``.  If set, the command line option overrides the
  value found in the config file.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR

  Package major version.  This variable will always be set, but its default
  value depends on whether or not version details were given to the
  ``project()`` command in the top level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version
  details were given, the default value will be
  ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR``.  If no version details were given,
  a default version of 0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR`` having a default value of 0.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR

  Package minor version.  The default value is determined based on whether or
  not version details were given to the ``project()`` command in the top
  level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version details were given, the default
  value will be ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR``, but if no minor
  version component was specified then ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR`` will be
  left unset.  If no project version was given at all, a default version of
  0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR`` having a
  default value of 1.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH

  Package patch version.  The default value is determined based on whether or
  not version details were given to the ``project()`` command in the top
  level CMakeLists.txt file.  If version details were given, the default
  value will be ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH``, but if no patch
  version component was specified then ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH`` will be
  left unset.  If no project version was given at all, a default version of
  0.1.1 will be assumed, leading to ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH`` having a
  default value of 1.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION

  A description of the project, used in places such as the introduction
  screen of CPack-generated Windows installers.  If not set, the value of
  this variable is populated from the file named by
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE

  A text file used to describe the project when
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`` is not explicitly set.  The default
  value for ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE`` points to a built-in template
  file ``Templates/CPack.GenericDescription.txt``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY

  Short description of the project (only a few words).  If the
  ``CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`` variable is set, it is used as the
  default value, otherwise the default will be a string generated by CMake
  based on ``CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE_URL

  Project homepage URL.  The default value is taken from the
  ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`` variable, which is set by the top
  level ``project()`` command, or else the default will be empty if no
  URL was provided to ``project()``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME

  The name of the package file to generate, not including the
  extension.  For example, ``cmake-2.6.1-Linux-i686``.  The default value
  is::

 ${CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME}-${CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION}-${CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME}

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY

  Installation directory on the target system. This may be used by some
  CPack generators like NSIS to create an installation directory e.g.,
  "CMake 2.5" below the installation prefix.  All installed elements will be
  put inside this directory.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_ICON

  A branding image that will be displayed inside the installer (used by GUI
  installers).

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM

  An algorithm that will be used to generate an additional file with the
  checksum of the package.  The output file name will be::

   ${CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME}.${CPACK_PACKAGE_CHECKSUM}

 Supported algorithms are those listed by the
 :ref:`string(\<HASH\>) <Supported Hash Algorithms>` command.

.. variable:: CPACK_PROJECT_CONFIG_FILE

  CPack-time project CPack configuration file.  This file is included at cpack
  time, once per generator after CPack has set ``CPACK_GENERATOR``
  to the actual generator being used.  It allows per-generator setting of
  ``CPACK_*`` variables at cpack time.

.. variable:: CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE

  License to be embedded in the installer.  It will typically be displayed
  to the user by the produced installer (often with an explicit "Accept"
  button, for graphical installers) prior to installation.  This license
  file is NOT added to the installed files but is used by some CPack generators
  like NSIS.  If you want to install a license file (may be the same as this
  one) along with your project, you must add an appropriate CMake
  ``install()`` command in your ``CMakeLists.txt``.

.. variable:: CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README

  ReadMe file to be embedded in the installer.  It typically describes in
  some detail the purpose of the project during the installation.  Not all
  CPack generators use this file.

.. variable:: CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME

  Welcome file to be embedded in the installer.  It welcomes users to this
  installer.  Typically used in the graphical installers on Windows and Mac
  OS X.

.. variable:: CPACK_MONOLITHIC_INSTALL

  Disables the component-based installation mechanism.  When set, the
  component specification is ignored and all installed items are put in a
  single "MONOLITHIC" package.  Some CPack generators do monolithic
  packaging by default and may be asked to do component packaging by
  setting ``CPACK_<GENNAME>_COMPONENT_INSTALL`` to ``TRUE``.

.. variable:: CPACK_GENERATOR

  List of CPack generators to use.  If not specified, CPack will create a
  set of options following the naming pattern
  ``CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>`` (e.g. ``CPACK_BINARY_NSIS``) allowing
  the user to enable/disable individual generators.  If the ``-G`` option is
  given on the ``cpack`` command line, it will override this
  variable and any ``CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>`` options.

.. variable:: CPACK_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE

  The name of the CPack binary configuration file.  This file is the CPack
  configuration generated by the CPack module for binary installers.
  Defaults to ``CPackConfig.cmake``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES

  Lists each of the executables and associated text label to be used to
  create Start Menu shortcuts.  For example, setting this to the list
  ``ccmake;CMake`` will create a shortcut named "CMake" that will execute the
  installed executable ``ccmake``.  Not all CPack generators use it (at least
  NSIS, WIX and OSXX11 do).

.. variable:: CPACK_STRIP_FILES

  List of files to be stripped.  Starting with CMake 2.6.0,
  ``CPACK_STRIP_FILES`` will be a boolean variable which enables
  stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates to ``TRUE`` in CMake,
  so this change is compatible).

.. variable:: CPACK_VERBATIM_VARIABLES

  If set to ``TRUE``, values of variables prefixed with ``CPACK_`` will be
  escaped before being written to the configuration files, so that the cpack
  program receives them exactly as they were specified.  If not, characters
  like quotes and backslashes can cause parsing errors or alter the value
  received by the cpack program.  Defaults to ``FALSE`` for backwards
  compatibility.

Variables for Source Package Generators
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following CPack variables are specific to source packages, and
will not affect binary packages:

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME

  The name of the source package.  For example ``cmake-2.6.1``.

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES

  List of files in the source tree that will be stripped.  Starting with
  CMake 2.6.0, ``CPACK_SOURCE_STRIP_FILES`` will be a boolean
  variable which enables stripping of all files (a list of files evaluates
  to ``TRUE`` in CMake, so this change is compatible).

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_GENERATOR

  List of generators used for the source packages.  As with
  ``CPACK_GENERATOR``, if this is not specified then CPack will
  create a set of options (e.g. ``CPACK_SOURCE_ZIP``) allowing
  users to select which packages will be generated.

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_OUTPUT_CONFIG_FILE

  The name of the CPack source configuration file.  This file is the CPack
  configuration generated by the CPack module for source installers.
  Defaults to ``CPackSourceConfig.cmake``.

.. variable:: CPACK_SOURCE_IGNORE_FILES

  Pattern of files in the source tree that won't be packaged when building
  a source package.  This is a list of regular expression patterns (that
  must be properly escaped), e.g.,
  ``/CVS/;/\\.svn/;\\.swp$;\\.#;/#;.*~;cscope.*``

Variables for Advanced Use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables are for advanced uses of CPack:

.. variable:: CPACK_CMAKE_GENERATOR

  What CMake generator should be used if the project is a CMake
  project.  Defaults to the value of ``CMAKE_GENERATOR``.  Few users
  will want to change this setting.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_CONFIGURATIONS

  Specify the project configurations to be packaged (e.g. ``Debug``, ``Release``,
  etc.). When the CMake project uses a multi-configuration generator such as Xcode
  or Visual Studio, this option can be used to specify what configurations
  to include in the package.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS

  List of four values that specify what project to install.  The four values
  are: Build directory, Project Name, Project Component, Directory.  If
  omitted, CPack will build an installer that installs everything.

.. variable:: CPACK_SYSTEM_NAME

  System name, defaults to the value of ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``,
  except on Windows where it will be ``win32`` or ``win64``.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION

  Package full version, used internally.  By default, this is built from
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MAJOR``,
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_MINOR``, and
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION_PATCH``.

.. variable:: CPACK_TOPLEVEL_TAG

  Directory for the installed files.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALL_COMMANDS

  Extra commands to install components.  The environment variable
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` is set to the temporary install directory
  during execution.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALL_SCRIPTS

  Extra CMake scripts executed by CPack during its local staging
  installation, which is done right before packaging the files.
  The scripts are not called by a standalone install (e.g.: ``make install``).
  For every script, the following variables will be set:
  ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``, ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``
  and ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` (which is set to the staging install
  directory).  The singular form ``CMAKE_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` is supported as
  an alternative variable for historical reasons, but its value is ignored if
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_SCRIPTS`` is set and a warning will be issued.

.. variable:: CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES

  Extra directories to install.

.. variable:: CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_REGISTRY_KEY

  Registry key used when installing this project.  This is only used by
  installers for Windows.  The default value is based on the installation
  directory.

.. variable:: CPACK_CREATE_DESKTOP_LINKS

  List of desktop links to create.  Each desktop link requires a
  corresponding start menu shortcut as created by
  ``CPACK_PACKAGE_EXECUTABLES``.

.. variable:: CPACK_BINARY_<GENNAME>

  CPack generated options for binary generators.  The ``CPack.cmake`` module
  generates (when ``CPACK_GENERATOR`` is not set) a set of CMake
  options (see CMake ``option()`` command) which may then be used to
  select the CPack generator(s) to be used when building the ``package``
  target or when running ``cpack`` without the ``-G`` option.


CSharpUtilities
---------------

Functions to make configuration of CSharp/.NET targets easier.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for dealing with CSharp
targets for Visual Studio generators from version 2010 and later.

The following functions are provided by this module:

**Main functions**

- ``csharp_set_windows_forms_properties()``
- ``csharp_set_designer_cs_properties()``
- ``csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties()``

**Helper functions**

- ``csharp_get_filename_keys()``
- ``csharp_get_filename_key_base()``
- ``csharp_get_dependentupon_name()``

Main functions provided by the module
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: csharp_set_windows_forms_properties

  Sets source file properties for use of Windows Forms. Use this, if your CSharp
  target uses Windows Forms::

   csharp_set_windows_forms_properties([<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``<fileN>``
   List of all source files which are relevant for setting the
   :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties (including ``.cs``, ``.resx`` and
   ``.Designer.cs`` extensions).

 In the list of all given files for all files ending with ``.Designer.cs`` and
 ``.resx`` is searched.  For every *designer* or *resource* file a file with the
 same base name but only ``.cs`` as extension is searched.  If this is found, the
 :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties are set as follows:

 for the **.cs** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_SubType "Form"

 for the **.Designer.cs** file (if it exists):
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <cs-filename>
  - VS_CSHARP_DesignTime "" (delete tag if previously defined)
  - VS_CSHARP_AutoGen ""(delete tag if previously defined)

 for the **.resx** file (if it exists):
  - VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR "" (delete tag if previously defined)
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <cs-filename>
  - VS_CSHARP_SubType "Designer"

.. command:: csharp_set_designer_cs_properties

  Sets source file properties of ``.Designer.cs`` files depending on
  sibling filenames. Use this, if your CSharp target does **not**
  use Windows Forms (for Windows Forms use
  ``csharp_set_designer_cs_properties()`` instead)::

   csharp_set_designer_cs_properties([<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``<fileN>``
   List of all source files which are relevant for setting the
   :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties (including ``.cs``,
   ``.resx``, ``.settings`` and ``.Designer.cs`` extensions).

 In the list of all given files for all files ending with
 ``.Designer.cs`` is searched. For every *designer* file all files
 with the same base name but different extensions are searched. If
 a match is found, the source file properties of the *designer* file
 are set depending on the extension of the matched file:

 if match is **.resx** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_AutoGen "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DesignTime "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <resx-filename>

 if match is **.cs** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <cs-filename>

 if match is **.settings** file:
  - VS_CSHARP_AutoGen "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DesignTimeSharedInput "True"
  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <settings-filename>

.. note::

    Because the source file properties of the ``.Designer.cs`` file are set according
    to the found matches and every match sets the **VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon**
    property, there should only be one match for each ``Designer.cs`` file.

.. command:: csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties

  Sets source file properties for use of Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) and
  XAML. Use this, if your CSharp target uses WPF/XAML::

   csharp_set_xaml_cs_properties([<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``<fileN>``
   List of all source files which are relevant for setting the
   :prop_sf:`VS_CSHARP_<tagname>` properties (including ``.cs``,
   ``.xaml``, and ``.xaml.cs`` extensions).

 In the list of all given files for all files ending with
 ``.xaml.cs`` is searched. For every *xaml-cs* file, a file
 with the same base name but extension ``.xaml`` is searched.
 If a match is found, the source file properties of the ``.xaml.cs``
 file are set:

  - VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <xaml-filename>

Helper functions which are used by the above ones
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: csharp_get_filename_keys

  Helper function which computes a list of key values to identify
  source files independently of relative/absolute paths given in cmake
  and eliminates case sensitivity::

   csharp_get_filename_keys(OUT [<file1> [<file2> [...]]])

 ``OUT``
   Name of the variable in which the list of keys is stored

 ``<fileN>``
   filename(s) as given to to CSharp target using :command:`add_library`
   or :command:`add_executable`

 In some way the function applies a canonicalization to the source names.
 This is necessary to find file matches if the files have been added to
 the target with different directory prefixes:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   add_library(lib
     myfile.cs
     ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/myfile.Designer.cs)

   set_source_files_properties(myfile.Designer.cs PROPERTIES
     VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon myfile.cs)

   # this will fail, because in cmake
   #  - ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/myfile.Designer.cs
   #  - myfile.Designer.cs
   # are not the same source file. The source file property is not set.

.. command:: csharp_get_filename_key_base

  Returns the full filepath and name **without** extension of a key.
  KEY is expected to be a key from csharp_get_filename_keys. In BASE
  the value of KEY without the file extension is returned::

   csharp_get_filename_key_base(BASE KEY)

 ``BASE``
   Name of the variable with the computed "base" of ``KEY``.

 ``KEY``
   The key of which the base will be computed. Expected to be a
   upper case full filename.

.. command:: csharp_get_dependentupon_name

  Computes a string which can be used as value for the source file property
  ``VS_CSHARP_<tagname>`` with *target* being ``DependentUpon``::

   csharp_get_dependentupon_name(NAME FILE)

 ``NAME``
   Name of the variable with the result value

 ``FILE``
   Filename to convert to ``<DependentUpon>`` value

 Actually this is only the filename without any path given at the moment.

CTest
-----

Configure a project for testing with CTest/CDash

Include this module in the top CMakeLists.txt file of a project to
enable testing with CTest and dashboard submissions to CDash::

 project(MyProject)
 ...
 include(CTest)

The module automatically creates a ``BUILD_TESTING`` option that selects
whether to enable testing support (``ON`` by default).  After including
the module, use code like::

 if(BUILD_TESTING)
   # ... CMake code to create tests ...
 endif()

to creating tests when testing is enabled.

To enable submissions to a CDash server, create a ``CTestConfig.cmake``
file at the top of the project with content such as::

 set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "01:00:00 UTC")
 set(CTEST_SUBMIT_URL "http://my.cdash.org/submit.php?project=MyProject")

(the CDash server can provide the file to a project administrator who
configures ``MyProject``).  Settings in the config file are shared by
both this ``CTest`` module and the ``ctest(1)`` command-line
:ref:`Dashboard Client` mode (``ctest -S``).

While building a project for submission to CDash, CTest scans the
build output for errors and warnings and reports them with surrounding
context from the build log.  This generic approach works for all build
tools, but does not give details about the command invocation that
produced a given problem.  One may get more detailed reports by setting
the ``CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS`` variable::

 set(CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS 1)

in the ``CTestConfig.cmake`` file.

CTestCoverageCollectGCOV
------------------------

This module provides the ``ctest_coverage_collect_gcov`` function.

This function runs gcov on all .gcda files found in the binary tree
and packages the resulting .gcov files into a tar file.
This tarball also contains the following:

* *data.json* defines the source and build directories for use by CDash.
* *Labels.json* indicates any ``LABELS`` that have been set on the
  source files.
* The *uncovered* directory holds any uncovered files found by
  ``CTEST_EXTRA_COVERAGE_GLOB``.

After generating this tar file, it can be sent to CDash for display with the
``ctest_submit(CDASH_UPLOAD)`` command.

.. command:: cdash_coverage_collect_gcov

  ::

   ctest_coverage_collect_gcov(TARBALL <tarfile>
     [SOURCE <source_dir>][BUILD <build_dir>]
     [GCOV_COMMAND <gcov_command>]
     [GCOV_OPTIONS <options>...]
     )

 Run gcov and package a tar file for CDash.  The options are:

 ``TARBALL <tarfile>``
   Specify the location of the ``.tar`` file to be created for later
   upload to CDash.  Relative paths will be interpreted with respect
   to the top-level build directory.

 ``SOURCE <source_dir>``
   Specify the top-level source directory for the build.
   Default is the value of :variable:`CTEST_SOURCE_DIRECTORY`.

 ``BUILD <build_dir>``
   Specify the top-level build directory for the build.
   Default is the value of :variable:`CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY`.

 ``GCOV_COMMAND <gcov_command>``
   Specify the full path to the ``gcov`` command on the machine.
   Default is the value of :variable:`CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND`.

 ``GCOV_OPTIONS <options>...``
   Specify options to be passed to gcov.  The ``gcov`` command
   is run as ``gcov <options>... -o <gcov-dir> <file>.gcda``.
   If not specified, the default option is just ``-b -x``.

 ``GLOB``
   Recursively search for .gcda files in build_dir rather than
   determining search locations by reading TargetDirectories.txt.

 ``DELETE``
   Delete coverage files after they've been packaged into the .tar.

 ``QUIET``
   Suppress non-error messages that otherwise would have been
   printed out by this function.

CTestScriptMode
---------------



This file is read by ctest in script mode (-S)

CTestUseLaunchers
-----------------

Set the RULE_LAUNCH_* global properties when CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on.

CTestUseLaunchers is automatically included when you include(CTest).
However, it is split out into its own module file so projects can use
the CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS functionality independently.

To use launchers, set CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS to ON in a ctest -S
dashboard script, and then also set it in the cache of the configured
project.  Both cmake and ctest need to know the value of it for the
launchers to work properly.  CMake needs to know in order to generate
proper build rules, and ctest, in order to produce the proper error
and warning analysis.

For convenience, you may set the ENV variable
CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS_DEFAULT in your ctest -S script, too.  Then, as
long as your CMakeLists uses include(CTest) or
include(CTestUseLaunchers), it will use the value of the ENV variable
to initialize a CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS cache variable.  This cache
variable initialization only occurs if CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is not
already defined. If CTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS is on in a ctest -S script
the ctest_configure command will add -DCTEST_USE_LAUNCHERS:BOOL=TRUE
to the cmake command used to configure the project.

Dart
----

Configure a project for testing with CTest or old Dart Tcl Client

This file is the backwards-compatibility version of the CTest module.
It supports using the old Dart 1 Tcl client for driving dashboard
submissions as well as testing with CTest.  This module should be
included in the CMakeLists.txt file at the top of a project.  Typical
usage:

::

 include(Dart)
 if(BUILD_TESTING)
   # ... testing related CMake code ...
 endif()

The BUILD_TESTING option is created by the Dart module to determine
whether testing support should be enabled.  The default is ON.

DeployQt4
---------

Functions to help assemble a standalone Qt4 executable.

A collection of CMake utility functions useful for deploying Qt4
executables.

The following functions are provided by this module:

::

 write_qt4_conf
 resolve_qt4_paths
 fixup_qt4_executable
 install_qt4_plugin_path
 install_qt4_plugin
 install_qt4_executable

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function and
PARENT_SCOPE.  Also depends on BundleUtilities.cmake.

::

 write_qt4_conf(<qt_conf_dir> <qt_conf_contents>)

Writes a qt.conf file with the <qt_conf_contents> into <qt_conf_dir>.

::

 resolve_qt4_paths(<paths_var> [<executable_path>])

Loop through <paths_var> list and if any don't exist resolve them
relative to the <executable_path> (if supplied) or the
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX.

::

 fixup_qt4_executable(<executable>
   [<qtplugins> <libs> <dirs> <plugins_dir> <request_qt_conf>])

Copies Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed) and
fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is standalone
and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine as long as all of
the system libraries are compatible.

<executable> should point to the executable to be fixed-up.

<qtplugins> should contain a list of the names or paths of any Qt
plugins to be installed.

<libs> will be passed to BundleUtilities and should be a list of any
already installed plugins, libraries or executables to also be
fixed-up.

<dirs> will be passed to BundleUtilities and should contain and
directories to be searched to find library dependencies.

<plugins_dir> allows an custom plugins directory to be used.

<request_qt_conf> will force a qt.conf file to be written even if not
needed.

::

 install_qt4_plugin_path(plugin executable copy installed_plugin_path_var
                         <plugins_dir> <component> <configurations>)

Install (or copy) a resolved <plugin> to the default plugins directory
(or <plugins_dir>) relative to <executable> and store the result in
<installed_plugin_path_var>.

If <copy> is set to TRUE then the plugins will be copied rather than
installed.  This is to allow this module to be used at CMake time
rather than install time.

Installs Qt plugins, writes a Qt configuration file (if needed) and
fixes up a Qt4 executable using BundleUtilities so it is standalone
and can be drag-and-drop copied to another machine as long as all of
the system libraries are compatible.  The executable will be fixed-up
at install time.  <component> is the COMPONENT used for bundle fixup
and plugin installation.  See documentation of FIXUP_QT4_BUNDLE.

Documentation
-------------

This module provides support for the VTK documentation framework.  It
relies on several tools (Doxygen, Perl, etc).

ExternalData
------------

Manage data files stored outside source tree

Introduction
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use this module to unambiguously reference data files stored outside
the source tree and fetch them at build time from arbitrary local and
remote content-addressed locations.  Functions provided by this module
recognize arguments with the syntax ``DATA{<name>}`` as references to
external data, replace them with full paths to local copies of those
data, and create build rules to fetch and update the local copies.

For example:

 include(ExternalData)
 set(ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES "file:///local/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                "file:////host/share/%(algo)/%(hash)"
                                "http://data.org/%(algo)/%(hash)")
 ExternalData_Add_Test(MyData
   NAME MyTest
   COMMAND MyExe DATA{MyInput.png}
   )
 ExternalData_Add_Target(MyData)

When test ``MyTest`` runs the ``DATA{MyInput.png}`` argument will be
replaced by the full path to a real instance of the data file
``MyInput.png`` on disk.  If the source tree contains a content link
such as ``MyInput.png.md5`` then the ``MyData`` target creates a real
``MyInput.png`` in the build tree.

Module Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: ExternalData_Expand_Arguments

  The ``ExternalData_Expand_Arguments`` function evaluates ``DATA{}``
  references in its arguments and constructs a new list of arguments::

   ExternalData_Expand_Arguments(
     <target>   # Name of data management target
     <outVar>   # Output variable
     [args...]  # Input arguments, DATA{} allowed
     )

 It replaces each ``DATA{}`` reference in an argument with the full path of
 a real data file on disk that will exist after the ``<target>`` builds.

.. command:: ExternalData_Add_Test

  The ``ExternalData_Add_Test`` function wraps around the CMake
  ``add_test()`` command but supports ``DATA{}`` references in
  its arguments::

   ExternalData_Add_Test(
     <target>   # Name of data management target
     ...        # Arguments of add_test(), DATA{} allowed
     )

 It passes its arguments through ``ExternalData_Expand_Arguments`` and then
 invokes the :command:`add_test` command using the results.

.. command:: ExternalData_Add_Target

  The ``ExternalData_Add_Target`` function creates a custom target to
  manage local instances of data files stored externally::

   ExternalData_Add_Target(
     <target>   # Name of data management target
     )

 It creates custom commands in the target as necessary to make data
 files available for each ``DATA{}`` reference previously evaluated by
 other functions provided by this module.
 Data files may be fetched from one of the URL templates specified in
 the ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` variable, or may be found locally
 in one of the paths specified in the ``ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES``
 variable.

 Typically only one target is needed to manage all external data within
 a project.  Call this function once at the end of configuration after
 all data references have been processed.

Module Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables configure behavior.  They should be set before
calling any of the functions provided by this module.

.. variable:: ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT

  The ``ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT`` variable may be set to the directory to
  hold the real data files named by expanded ``DATA{}`` references.  The
  default is ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``.  The directory layout will mirror that of
  content links under ``ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT``.

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_<key>

  Specify a full path to a ``.cmake`` custom fetch script identified by
  ``<key>`` in entries of the ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` list.
  See Custom Fetch Scripts.

.. variable:: ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT

  The ``ExternalData_LINK_CONTENT`` variable may be set to the name of a
  supported hash algorithm to enable automatic conversion of real data
  files referenced by the ``DATA{}`` syntax into content links.  For each
  such ``<file>`` a content link named ``<file><ext>`` is created.  The
  original file is renamed to the form ``.ExternalData_<algo>_<hash>`` to
  stage it for future transmission to one of the locations in the list
  of URL templates (by means outside the scope of this module).  The
  data fetch rule created for the content link will use the staged
  object if it cannot be found using any URL template.

.. variable:: ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS

  The real data files named by expanded ``DATA{}`` references may be made
  available under ``ExternalData_BINARY_ROOT`` using symbolic links on
  some platforms.  The ``ExternalData_NO_SYMLINKS`` variable may be set
  to disable use of symbolic links and enable use of copies instead.

.. variable:: ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES

  The ``ExternalData_OBJECT_STORES`` variable may be set to a list of local
  directories that store objects using the layout ``<dir>/%(algo)/%(hash)``.
  These directories will be searched first for a needed object.  If the
  object is not available in any store then it will be fetched remotely
  using the URL templates and added to the first local store listed.  If
  no stores are specified the default is a location inside the build
  tree.

.. variable:: ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE
              ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX
              ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER
              ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX
              ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH

  See Referencing File Series.

.. variable:: ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT

  The ``ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT`` variable may be set to the highest source
  directory containing any path named by a ``DATA{}`` reference.  The
  default is ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``.  ``ExternalData_SOURCE_ROOT`` and
  ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` must refer to directories within a single source
  distribution (e.g.  they come together in one tarball).

.. variable:: ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE

  The ``ExternalData_TIMEOUT_ABSOLUTE`` variable sets the download
  absolute timeout, in seconds, with a default of ``300`` seconds.
  Set to ``0`` to disable enforcement.

.. variable:: ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY

  The ``ExternalData_TIMEOUT_INACTIVITY`` variable sets the download
  inactivity timeout, in seconds, with a default of ``60`` seconds.
  Set to ``0`` to disable enforcement.

.. variable:: ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>

  Specify a custom URL component to be substituted for URL template
  placeholders of the form ``%(algo:<key>)``, where ``<key>`` is a
  valid C identifier, when fetching an object referenced via hash
  algorithm ``<algo>``.  If not defined, the default URL component
  is just ``<algo>`` for any ``<key>``.

.. variable:: ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES

  The ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` may be set to provide a list of
  of URL templates using the placeholders ``%(algo)`` and ``%(hash)``
  in each template.  Data fetch rules try each URL template in order
  by substituting the hash algorithm name for ``%(algo)`` and the hash
  value for ``%(hash)``.  Alternatively one may use ``%(algo:<key>)``
  with ``ExternalData_URL_ALGO_<algo>_<key>`` variables to gain more
  flexibility in remote URLs.

Referencing Files
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Referencing Single Files
""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax is literal and the ``<name>`` is a full or relative path
within the source tree.  The source tree must contain either a real
data file at ``<name>`` or a "content link" at ``<name><ext>`` containing a
hash of the real file using a hash algorithm corresponding to ``<ext>``.
For example, the argument ``DATA{img.png}`` may be satisfied by either a
real ``img.png`` file in the current source directory or a ``img.png.md5``
file containing its MD5 sum.

Multiple content links of the same name with different hash algorithms
are supported (e.g. ``img.png.sha256`` and ``img.png.sha1``) so long as
they all correspond to the same real file.  This allows objects to be
fetched from sources indexed by different hash algorithms.

Referencing File Series
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax can be told to fetch a file series using the form
``DATA{<name>,:}``, where the ``:`` is literal.  If the source tree
contains a group of files or content links named like a series then a
reference to one member adds rules to fetch all of them.  Although all
members of a series are fetched, only the file originally named by the
``DATA{}`` argument is substituted for it.  The default configuration
recognizes file series names ending with ``#.ext``, ``_#.ext``, ``.#.ext``,
or ``-#.ext`` where ``#`` is a sequence of decimal digits and ``.ext`` is
any single extension.  Configure it with a regex that parses ``<number>``
and ``<suffix>`` parts from the end of ``<name>``::

 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex of the form (<number>)(<suffix>)$

For more complicated cases set::

 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE = regex with at least two () groups
 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_PREFIX = <prefix> regex group number, if any
 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_NUMBER = <number> regex group number
 ExternalData_SERIES_PARSE_SUFFIX = <suffix> regex group number

Configure series number matching with a regex that matches the
``<number>`` part of series members named ``<prefix><number><suffix>``::

 ExternalData_SERIES_MATCH = regex matching <number> in all series members

Note that the ``<suffix>`` of a series does not include a hash-algorithm
extension.

Referencing Associated Files
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax can alternatively match files associated with the
named file and contained in the same directory.  Associated files may
be specified by options using the syntax
``DATA{<name>,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}``.  Each option may specify one file by
name or specify a regular expression to match file names using the
syntax ``REGEX:<regex>``.  For example, the arguments::

 DATA{MyData/MyInput.mhd,MyInput.img}                   # File pair
 DATA{MyData/MyFrames00.png,REGEX:MyFrames[0-9]+\\.png} # Series

will pass ``MyInput.mha`` and ``MyFrames00.png`` on the command line but
ensure that the associated files are present next to them.

Referencing Directories
"""""""""""""""""""""""

The ``DATA{}`` syntax may reference a directory using a trailing slash and
a list of associated files.  The form ``DATA{<name>/,<opt1>,<opt2>,...}``
adds rules to fetch any files in the directory that match one of the
associated file options.  For example, the argument
``DATA{MyDataDir/,REGEX:.*}`` will pass the full path to a ``MyDataDir``
directory on the command line and ensure that the directory contains
files corresponding to every file or content link in the ``MyDataDir``
source directory.  In order to match associated files in subdirectories,
specify a ``RECURSE:`` option, e.g. ``DATA{MyDataDir/,RECURSE:,REGEX:.*}``.

Hash Algorithms
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following hash algorithms are supported::

 %(algo)     <ext>     Description
 -------     -----     -----------
 MD5         .md5      Message-Digest Algorithm 5, RFC 1321
 SHA1        .sha1     US Secure Hash Algorithm 1, RFC 3174
 SHA224      .sha224   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA256      .sha256   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA384      .sha384   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA512      .sha512   US Secure Hash Algorithms, RFC 4634
 SHA3_224    .sha3-224 Keccak SHA-3
 SHA3_256    .sha3-256 Keccak SHA-3
 SHA3_384    .sha3-384 Keccak SHA-3
 SHA3_512    .sha3-512 Keccak SHA-3

Note that the hashes are used only for unique data identification and
download verification.

Custom Fetch Scripts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When a data file must be fetched from one of the URL templates
specified in the ``ExternalData_URL_TEMPLATES`` variable, it is
normally downloaded using the ``file(DOWNLOAD)`` command.
One may specify usage of a custom fetch script by using a URL
template of the form ``ExternalDataCustomScript://<key>/<loc>``.
The ``<key>`` must be a C identifier, and the ``<loc>`` must
contain the ``%(algo)`` and ``%(hash)`` placeholders.
A variable corresponding to the key, ``ExternalData_CUSTOM_SCRIPT_<key>``,
must be set to the full path to a ``.cmake`` script file.  The script
will be included to perform the actual fetch, and provided with
the following variables:

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_LOCATION

  When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the
  location part of the URL, which will contain the substituted hash
  algorithm name and content hash value.

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_FILE

  When a custom fetch script is loaded, this variable is set to the
  full path to a file in which the script must store the fetched
  content.  The name of the file is unspecified and should not be
  interpreted in any way.

The custom fetch script is expected to store fetched content in the
file or set a variable:

.. variable:: ExternalData_CUSTOM_ERROR

  When a custom fetch script fails to fetch the requested content,
  it must set this variable to a short one-line message describing
  the reason for failure.


ExternalProject
---------------

External Project Definition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add

  The ``ExternalProject_Add()`` function creates a custom target to drive
  download, update/patch, configure, build, install and test steps of an
  external project:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add(<name> [<option>...])

  The individual steps within the process can be driven independently if
  required (e.g. for CDash submission) and extra custom steps can be defined,
  along with the ability to control the step dependencies. The directory
  structure used for the management of the external project can also be
  customized. The function supports a large number of options which can be used
  to tailor the external project behavior.

  **Directory Options:**
    Most of the time, the default directory layout is sufficient. It is largely
    an implementation detail that the main project usually doesn't need to
    change. In some circumstances, however, control over the directory layout
    can be useful or necessary. The directory options are potentially more
    useful from the point of view that the main build can use the
    ``ExternalProject_Get_Property()`` command to retrieve their values,
    thereby allowing the main project to refer to build artifacts of the
    external project.

    ``PREFIX <dir>``
      Root directory for the external project. Unless otherwise noted below,
      all other directories associated with the external project will be
      created under here.

    ``TMP_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store temporary files.

    ``STAMP_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store the timestamps of each step. Log files from
      individual steps are also created in here unless overridden by LOG_DIR
      (see *Logging Options* below).

    ``LOG_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store the logs of each step.

    ``DOWNLOAD_DIR <dir>``
      Directory in which to store downloaded files before unpacking them. This
      directory is only used by the URL download method, all other download
      methods use ``SOURCE_DIR`` directly instead.

    ``SOURCE_DIR <dir>``
      Source directory into which downloaded contents will be unpacked, or for
      non-URL download methods, the directory in which the repository should be
      checked out, cloned, etc. If no download method is specified, this must
      point to an existing directory where the external project has already
      been unpacked or cloned/checked out.

      .. note::
         If a download method is specified, any existing contents of the source
         directory may be deleted. Only the URL download method checks whether
         this directory is either missing or empty before initiating the
         download, stopping with an error if it is not empty. All other
         download methods silently discard any previous contents of the source
         directory.

    ``BINARY_DIR <dir>``
      Specify the build directory location. This option is ignored if
      ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE`` is enabled.

    ``INSTALL_DIR <dir>``
      Installation prefix to be placed in the ``<INSTALL_DIR>`` placeholder.
      This does not actually configure the external project to install to
      the given prefix. That must be done by passing appropriate arguments
      to the external project configuration step, e.g. using ``<INSTALL_DIR>``.

    If any of the above ``..._DIR`` options are not specified, their defaults
    are computed as follows. If the ``PREFIX`` option is given or the
    ``EP_PREFIX`` directory property is set, then an external project is built
    and installed under the specified prefix::

     TMP_DIR      = <prefix>/tmp
     STAMP_DIR    = <prefix>/src/<name>-stamp
     DOWNLOAD_DIR = <prefix>/src
     SOURCE_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>
     BINARY_DIR   = <prefix>/src/<name>-build
     INSTALL_DIR  = <prefix>
     LOG_DIR      = <STAMP_DIR>

   Otherwise, if the ``EP_BASE`` directory property is set then components
   of an external project are stored under the specified base::

     TMP_DIR      = <base>/tmp/<name>
     STAMP_DIR    = <base>/Stamp/<name>
     DOWNLOAD_DIR = <base>/Download/<name>
     SOURCE_DIR   = <base>/Source/<name>
     BINARY_DIR   = <base>/Build/<name>
     INSTALL_DIR  = <base>/Install/<name>
     LOG_DIR      = <STAMP_DIR>

   If no ``PREFIX``, ``EP_PREFIX``, or ``EP_BASE`` is specified, then the
   default is to set ``PREFIX`` to ``<name>-prefix``. Relative paths are
   interpreted with respect to :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` at the
   point where ``ExternalProject_Add()`` is called.

 **Download Step Options:**
   A download method can be omitted if the ``SOURCE_DIR`` option is used to
   point to an existing non-empty directory. Otherwise, one of the download
   methods below must be specified (multiple download methods should not be
   given) or a custom ``DOWNLOAD_COMMAND`` provided.

   ``DOWNLOAD_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the command used for the download step
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). If this option is specified, all other download options will
     be ignored. Providing an empty string for ``<cmd>`` effectively disables
     the download step.

   *URL Download*
     ``URL <url1> [<url2>...]``
       List of paths and/or URL(s) of the external project's source. When more
       than one URL is given, they are tried in turn until one succeeds. A URL
       may be an ordinary path in the local file system (in which case it
       must be the only URL provided) or any downloadable URL supported by the
       :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)` command. A local filesystem path may refer to
       either an existing directory or to an archive file, whereas a URL is
       expected to point to a file which can be treated as an archive. When an
       archive is used, it will be unpacked automatically unless the
       ``DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT`` option is set to prevent it. The archive type
       is determined by inspecting the actual content rather than using logic
       based on the file extension.

     ``URL_HASH <algo>=<hashValue>``
       Hash of the archive file to be downloaded. The argument should be of
       the form ``<algo>=<hashValue>`` where ``algo`` can be any of the hashing
       algorithms supported by the :command:`file()` command. Specifying this
       option is strongly recommended for URL downloads, as it ensures the
       integrity of the downloaded content. It is also used as a check for a
       previously downloaded file, allowing connection to the remote location
       to be avoided altogether if the local directory already has a file from
       an earlier download that matches the specified hash.

     ``URL_MD5 <md5>``
       Equivalent to ``URL_HASH MD5=<md5>``.

     ``DOWNLOAD_NAME <fname>``
       File name to use for the downloaded file. If not given, the end of the
       URL is used to determine the file name. This option is rarely needed,
       the default name is generally suitable and is not normally used outside
       of code internal to the ``ExternalProject`` module.

     ``DOWNLOAD_NO_EXTRACT <bool>``
       Allows the extraction part of the download step to be disabled by
       passing a boolean true value for this option. If this option is not
       given, the downloaded contents will be unpacked automatically if
       required. If extraction has been disabled, the full path to the
       downloaded file is available as ``<DOWNLOADED_FILE>`` in subsequent
       steps or as the property ``DOWNLOADED_FILE`` with the
       :command:`ExternalProject_Get_Property` command.

     ``DOWNLOAD_NO_PROGRESS <bool>``
       Can be used to disable logging the download progress. If this option is
       not given, download progress messages will be logged.

     ``TIMEOUT <seconds>``
       Maximum time allowed for file download operations.

     ``HTTP_USERNAME <username>``
       Username for the download operation if authentication is required.

     ``HTTP_PASSWORD <password>``
       Password for the download operation if authentication is required.

     ``HTTP_HEADER <header1> [<header2>...]``
       Provides an arbitrary list of HTTP headers for the download operation.
       This can be useful for accessing content in systems like AWS, etc.

     ``TLS_VERIFY <bool>``
       Specifies whether certificate verification should be performed for
       https URLs. If this option is not provided, the default behavior is
       determined by the ``CMAKE_TLS_VERIFY`` variable (see
       :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`). If that is also not set, certificate
       verification will not be performed. In situations where ``URL_HASH``
       cannot be provided, this option can be an alternative verification
       measure.

     ``TLS_CAINFO <file>``
       Specify a custom certificate authority file to use if ``TLS_VERIFY``
       is enabled. If this option is not specified, the value of the
       ``CMAKE_TLS_CAINFO`` variable will be used instead (see
       :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`)

     ``NETRC <level>``
       Specify whether the ``.netrc`` file is to be used for operation.
       If this option is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC``
       variable will be used instead (see :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`)
       Valid levels are:

       ``IGNORED``
         The ``.netrc`` file is ignored.
         This is the default.
       ``OPTIONAL``
         The ``.netrc`` file is optional, and information in the URL
         is preferred.  The file will be scanned to find which ever
         information is not specified in the URL.
       ``REQUIRED``
         The ``.netrc`` file is required, and information in the URL
         is ignored.

     ``NETRC_FILE <file>``
       Specify an alternative ``.netrc`` file to the one in your home directory
       if the ``NETRC`` level is ``OPTIONAL`` or ``REQUIRED``. If this option
       is not specified, the value of the ``CMAKE_NETRC_FILE`` variable will
       be used instead (see :command:`file(DOWNLOAD)`)

   *Git*
     NOTE: A git version of 1.6.5 or later is required if this download method
     is used.

     ``GIT_REPOSITORY <url>``
       URL of the git repository. Any URL understood by the ``git`` command
       may be used.

     ``GIT_TAG <tag>``
       Git branch name, tag or commit hash. Note that branch names and tags
       should generally be specified as remote names (i.e. ``origin/myBranch``
       rather than simply ``myBranch``). This ensures that if the remote end
       has its tag moved or branch rebased or history rewritten, the local
       clone will still be updated correctly. In general, however, specifying
       a commit hash should be preferred for a number of reasons:

       - If the local clone already has the commit corresponding to the hash,
         no ``git fetch`` needs to be performed to check for changes each time
         CMake is re-run. This can result in a significant speed up if many
         external projects are being used.
       - Using a specific git hash ensures that the main project's own history
         is fully traceable to a specific point in the external project's
         evolution. If a branch or tag name is used instead, then checking out
         a specific commit of the main project doesn't necessarily pin the
         whole build to a specific point in the life of the external project.
         The lack of such deterministic behavior makes the main project lose
         traceability and repeatability.

       If ``GIT_SHALLOW`` is enabled then ``GIT_TAG`` works only with
       branch names and tags.  A commit hash is not allowed.

     ``GIT_REMOTE_NAME <name>``
       The optional name of the remote. If this option is not specified, it
       defaults to ``origin``.

     ``GIT_SUBMODULES <module>...``
       Specific git submodules that should also be updated. If this option is
       not provided, all git submodules will be updated. When :policy:`CMP0097`
       is set to ``NEW`` if this value is set to an empty string then no submodules
       are initialized or updated.

     ``GIT_SHALLOW <bool>``
       When this option is enabled, the ``git clone`` operation will be given
       the ``--depth 1`` option. This performs a shallow clone, which avoids
       downloading the whole history and instead retrieves just the commit
       denoted by the ``GIT_TAG`` option.

     ``GIT_PROGRESS <bool>``
       When enabled, this option instructs the ``git clone`` operation to
       report its progress by passing it the ``--progress`` option. Without
       this option, the clone step for large projects may appear to make the
       build stall, since nothing will be logged until the clone operation
       finishes. While this option can be used to provide progress to prevent
       the appearance of the build having stalled, it may also make the build
       overly noisy if lots of external projects are used.

     ``GIT_CONFIG <option1> [<option2>...]``
       Specify a list of config options to pass to ``git clone``. Each option
       listed will be transformed into its own ``--config <option>`` on the
       ``git clone`` command line, with each option required to be in the
       form ``key=value``.

   *Subversion*
     ``SVN_REPOSITORY <url>``
       URL of the Subversion repository.

     ``SVN_REVISION -r<rev>``
       Revision to checkout from the Subversion repository.

     ``SVN_USERNAME <username>``
       Username for the Subversion checkout and update.

     ``SVN_PASSWORD <password>``
       Password for the Subversion checkout and update.

     ``SVN_TRUST_CERT <bool>``
       Specifies whether to trust the Subversion server site certificate. If
       enabled, the ``--trust-server-cert`` option is passed to the ``svn``
       checkout and update commands.

   *Mercurial*
     ``HG_REPOSITORY <url>``
       URL of the mercurial repository.

     ``HG_TAG <tag>``
       Mercurial branch name, tag or commit id.

   *CVS*
     ``CVS_REPOSITORY <cvsroot>``
       CVSROOT of the CVS repository.

     ``CVS_MODULE <mod>``
       Module to checkout from the CVS repository.

     ``CVS_TAG <tag>``
       Tag to checkout from the CVS repository.

 **Update/Patch Step Options:**
   Whenever CMake is re-run, by default the external project's sources will be
   updated if the download method supports updates (e.g. a git repository
   would be checked if the ``GIT_TAG`` does not refer to a specific commit).

   ``UPDATE_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the download method's update step with a custom command.
     The command may use
     :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

   ``UPDATE_DISCONNECTED <bool>``
     When enabled, this option causes the update step to be skipped. It does
     not, however, prevent the download step. The update step can still be
     added as a step target (see :command:`ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets`)
     and called manually. This is useful if you want to allow developers to
     build the project when disconnected from the network (the network may
     still be needed for the download step though).

     When this option is present, it is generally advisable to make the value
     a cache variable under the developer's control rather than hard-coding
     it. If this option is not present, the default value is taken from the
     ``EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED`` directory property. If that is also not
     defined, updates are performed as normal. The ``EP_UPDATE_DISCONNECTED``
     directory property is intended as a convenience for controlling the
     ``UPDATE_DISCONNECTED`` behavior for an entire section of a project's
     directory hierarchy and may be a more convenient method of giving
     developers control over whether or not to perform updates (assuming the
     project also provides a cache variable or some other convenient method
     for setting the directory property).

   ``PATCH_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Specifies a custom command to patch the sources after an update. By
     default, no patch command is defined. Note that it can be quite difficult
     to define an appropriate patch command that performs robustly, especially
     for download methods such as git where changing the ``GIT_TAG`` will not
     discard changes from a previous patch, but the patch command will be
     called again after updating to the new tag.

 **Configure Step Options:**
   The configure step is run after the download and update steps. By default,
   the external project is assumed to be a CMake project, but this can be
   overridden if required.

   ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     The default configure command runs CMake with options based on the main
     project. For non-CMake external projects, the ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``
     option must be used to override this behavior
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). For projects that require no configure step, specify this
     option with an empty string as the command to execute.

   ``CMAKE_COMMAND /.../cmake``
     Specify an alternative cmake executable for the configure step (use an
     absolute path). This is generally not recommended, since it is
     usually desirable to use the same CMake version throughout the whole
     build. This option is ignored if a custom configure command has been
     specified with ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR <gen>``
     Override the CMake generator used for the configure step. Without this
     option, the same generator as the main build will be used. This option is
     ignored if a custom configure command has been specified with the
     ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND`` option.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM <platform>``
     Pass a generator-specific platform name to the CMake command (see
     :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`). It is an error to provide this
     option without the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` option.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET <toolset>``
     Pass a generator-specific toolset name to the CMake command (see
     :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`). It is an error to provide this
     option without the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` option.

   ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE <instance>``
     Pass a generator-specific instance selection to the CMake command (see
     :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`). It is an error to provide this
     option without the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` option.

   ``CMAKE_ARGS <arg>...``
     The specified arguments are passed to the ``cmake`` command line. They
     can be any argument the ``cmake`` command understands, not just cache
     values defined by ``-D...`` arguments (see also
     :manual:`CMake Options <cmake(1)>`). In addition, arguments may use
     :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

   ``CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS <arg>...``
     This is an alternate way of specifying cache variables where command line
     length issues may become a problem. The arguments are expected to be in
     the form ``-Dvar:STRING=value``, which are then transformed into
     CMake :command:`set` commands with the ``FORCE`` option used. These
     ``set()`` commands are written to a pre-load script which is then applied
     using the :manual:`cmake -C <cmake(1)>` command line option. Arguments
     may use :manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>`.

   ``CMAKE_CACHE_DEFAULT_ARGS <arg>...``
     This is the same as the ``CMAKE_CACHE_ARGS`` option except the ``set()``
     commands do not include the ``FORCE`` keyword. This means the values act
     as initial defaults only and will not override any variables already set
     from a previous run. Use this option with care, as it can lead to
     different behavior depending on whether the build starts from a fresh
     build directory or re-uses previous build contents.

     If the CMake generator is the ``Green Hills MULTI`` and not overridden then
     the original project's settings for the GHS toolset and target system
     customization cache variables are propagated into the external project.

   ``SOURCE_SUBDIR <dir>``
     When no ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND`` option is specified, the configure step
     assumes the external project has a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file at the top of
     its source tree (i.e. in ``SOURCE_DIR``). The ``SOURCE_SUBDIR`` option
     can be used to point to an alternative directory within the source tree
     to use as the top of the CMake source tree instead. This must be a
     relative path and it will be interpreted as being relative to
     ``SOURCE_DIR``.  When ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE 1`` is specified, the
     ``BUILD_COMMAND`` is used to point to an alternative directory within the
     source tree.

 **Build Step Options:**
   If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build
   system, the build step will also. Otherwise, the build step will assume a
   Makefile-based build and simply run ``make`` with no arguments as the
   default build step. This can be overridden with custom build commands if
   required.

   ``BUILD_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the default build command
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). If this option is not given, the default build command will
     be chosen to integrate with the main build in the most appropriate way
     (e.g. using recursive ``make`` for Makefile generators or
     ``cmake --build`` if the project uses a CMake build). This option can be
     specified with an empty string as the command to make the build step do
     nothing.

   ``BUILD_IN_SOURCE <bool>``
     When this option is enabled, the build will be done directly within the
     external project's source tree. This should generally be avoided, the use
     of a separate build directory is usually preferred, but it can be useful
     when the external project assumes an in-source build. The ``BINARY_DIR``
     option should not be specified if building in-source.

   ``BUILD_ALWAYS <bool>``
     Enabling this option forces the build step to always be run. This can be
     the easiest way to robustly ensure that the external project's own build
     dependencies are evaluated rather than relying on the default
     success timestamp-based method. This option is not normally needed unless
     developers are expected to modify something the external project's build
     depends on in a way that is not detectable via the step target
     dependencies (e.g. ``SOURCE_DIR`` is used without a download method and
     developers might modify the sources in ``SOURCE_DIR``).

   ``BUILD_BYPRODUCTS <file>...``
     Specifies files that will be generated by the build command but which
     might or might not have their modification time updated by subsequent
     builds. These ultimately get passed through as ``BYPRODUCTS`` to the
     build step's own underlying call to :command:`add_custom_command`.

 **Install Step Options:**
   If the configure step assumed the external project uses CMake as its build
   system, the install step will also. Otherwise, the install step will assume
   a Makefile-based build and simply run ``make install`` as the default build
   step. This can be overridden with custom install commands if required.

   ``INSTALL_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     The external project's own install step is invoked as part of the main
     project's *build*. It is done after the external project's build step
     and may be before or after the external project's test step (see the
     ``TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL`` option below). The external project's install
     rules are not part of the main project's install rules, so if anything
     from the external project should be installed as part of the main build,
     these need to be specified in the main build as additional
     :command:`install` commands. The default install step builds the
     ``install`` target of the external project, but this can be overridden
     with a custom command using this option
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). Passing an empty string as the ``<cmd>`` makes the install
     step do nothing.

 **Test Step Options:**
   The test step is only defined if at least one of the following ``TEST_...``
   options are provided.

   ``TEST_COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Overrides the default test command
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). If this option is not given, the default behavior of the test
     step is to build the external project's own ``test`` target. This option
     can be specified with ``<cmd>`` as an empty string, which allows the test
     step to still be defined, but it will do nothing. Do not specify any of
     the other ``TEST_...`` options if providing an empty string as the test
     command, but prefer to omit all ``TEST_...`` options altogether if the
     test step target is not needed.

   ``TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL <bool>``
     When this option is enabled, the test step will be executed before the
     install step. The default behavior is for the test step to run after the
     install step.

   ``TEST_AFTER_INSTALL <bool>``
     This option is mainly useful as a way to indicate that the test step is
     desired but all default behavior is sufficient. Specifying this option
     with a boolean true value ensures the test step is defined and that it
     comes after the install step. If both ``TEST_BEFORE_INSTALL`` and
     ``TEST_AFTER_INSTALL`` are enabled, the latter is silently ignored.

   ``TEST_EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN <bool>``
     If enabled, the main build's default ALL target will not depend on the
     test step. This can be a useful way of ensuring the test step is defined
     but only gets invoked when manually requested.

 **Output Logging Options:**
   Each of the following ``LOG_...`` options can be used to wrap the relevant
   step in a script to capture its output to files. The log files will be
   created in ``LOG_DIR`` if supplied or otherwise the ``STAMP_DIR``
   directory with step-specific file names.

   ``LOG_DOWNLOAD <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the download step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_UPDATE <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the update step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_PATCH <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the patch step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_CONFIGURE <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the configure step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_BUILD <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the build step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_INSTALL <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the install step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_TEST <bool>``
     When enabled, the output of the test step is logged to files.

   ``LOG_MERGED_STDOUTERR <bool>``
     When enabled, stdout and stderr will be merged for any step whose
     output is being logged to files.

   ``LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE <bool>``
     This option only has an effect if at least one of the other ``LOG_<step>``
     options is enabled.  If an error occurs for a step which has logging to
     file enabled, that step's output will be printed to the console if
     ``LOG_OUTPUT_ON_FAILURE`` is set to true.  For cases where a large amount
     of output is recorded, just the end of that output may be printed to the
     console.

 **Terminal Access Options:**
   Steps can be given direct access to the terminal in some cases. Giving a
   step access to the terminal may allow it to receive terminal input if
   required, such as for authentication details not provided by other options.
   With the :generator:`Ninja` generator, these options place the steps in the
   ``console`` :prop_gbl:`job pool <JOB_POOLS>`. Each step can be given access
   to the terminal individually via the following options:

   ``USES_TERMINAL_DOWNLOAD <bool>``
     Give the download step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_UPDATE <bool>``
     Give the update step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_CONFIGURE <bool>``
     Give the configure step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_BUILD <bool>``
     Give the build step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_INSTALL <bool>``
     Give the install step access to the terminal.

   ``USES_TERMINAL_TEST <bool>``
     Give the test step access to the terminal.

 **Target Options:**
   ``DEPENDS <targets>...``
     Specify other targets on which the external project depends. The other
     targets will be brought up to date before any of the external project's
     steps are executed. Because the external project uses additional custom
     targets internally for each step, the ``DEPENDS`` option is the most
     convenient way to ensure all of those steps depend on the other targets.
     Simply doing
     :command:`add_dependencies(\<name\> \<targets\>) <add_dependencies>` will
     not make any of the steps dependent on ``<targets>``.

   ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL <bool>``
     When enabled, this option excludes the external project from the default
     ALL target of the main build.

   ``STEP_TARGETS <step-target>...``
     Generate custom targets for the specified steps. This is required if the
     steps need to be triggered manually or if they need to be used as
     dependencies of other targets. If this option is not specified, the
     default value is taken from the ``EP_STEP_TARGETS`` directory property.
     See :command:`ExternalProject_Add_Step` below for further discussion of
     the effects of this option.

   ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS <step-target>...``
     Generate custom targets for the specified steps and prevent these targets
     from having the usual dependencies applied to them. If this option is not
     specified, the default value is taken from the
     ``EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` directory property. This option is mostly
     useful for allowing individual steps to be driven independently, such as
     for a CDash setup where each step should be initiated and reported
     individually rather than as one whole build. See
     :command:`ExternalProject_Add_Step` below for further discussion of the
     effects of this option.

 **Miscellaneous Options:**
   ``LIST_SEPARATOR <sep>``
     For any of the various ``..._COMMAND`` options, replace ``;`` with
     ``<sep>`` in the specified command lines. This can be useful where list
     variables may be given in commands where they should end up as
     space-separated arguments (``<sep>`` would be a single space character
     string in this case).

   ``COMMAND <cmd>...``
     Any of the other ``..._COMMAND`` options can have additional commands
     appended to them by following them with as many ``COMMAND ...`` options
     as needed
     (:manual:`generator expressions <cmake-generator-expressions(7)>` are
     supported). For example:

     .. code-block:: cmake

       ExternalProject_Add(example
         ... # Download options, etc.
         BUILD_COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "Starting $<CONFIG> build"
         COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} --build <BINARY_DIR> --config $<CONFIG>
         COMMAND       ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E echo "$<CONFIG> build complete"
       )

 It should also be noted that each build step is created via a call to
 :command:`ExternalProject_Add_Step`. See that command's documentation for the
 automatic substitutions that are supported for some options.

Obtaining Project Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: ExternalProject_Get_Property

  The ``ExternalProject_Get_Property()`` function retrieves external project
  target properties:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Get_Property(<name> <prop1> [<prop2>...])

  The function stores property values in variables of the same name. Property
  names correspond to the keyword argument names of ``ExternalProject_Add()``.
  For example, the source directory might be retrieved like so:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Get_property(myExtProj SOURCE_DIR)
    message("Source dir of myExtProj = ${SOURCE_DIR}")

Explicit Step Management
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``ExternalProject_Add()`` function on its own is often sufficient for
incorporating an external project into the main build. Certain scenarios
require additional work to implement desired behavior, such as adding in a
custom step or making steps available as manually triggerable targets. The
``ExternalProject_Add_Step()``, ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` and
``ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies`` functions provide the lower level
control needed to implement such step-level capabilities.

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add_Step

  The ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()`` function specifies an additional custom
  step for an external project defined by an earlier call to
  ``ExternalProject_Add()``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add_Step(<name> <step> [<option>...])

  ``<name>`` is the same as the name passed to the original call to
  ``ExternalProject_Add()``. The specified ``<step>`` must not be one of
  the pre-defined steps (``mkdir``, ``download``, ``update``, ``skip-update``,
  ``patch``, ``configure``, ``build``, ``install`` or ``test``). The supported
  options are:

  ``COMMAND <cmd>...``
    The command line to be executed by this custom step
    (``generator expressions`` are
    supported). This option can be repeated multiple times to specify multiple
    commands to be executed in order.

  ``COMMENT "<text>..."``
    Text to be printed when the custom step executes.

  ``DEPENDEES <step>...``
    Other steps (custom or pre-defined) on which this step depends.

  ``DEPENDERS <step>...``
    Other steps (custom or pre-defined) that depend on this new custom step.

  ``DEPENDS <file>...``
    Files on which this custom step depends.

  ``BYPRODUCTS <file>...``
    Files that will be generated by this custom step but which might or might
    not have their modification time updated by subsequent builds. This list of
    files will ultimately be passed through as the ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to the
    ``add_custom_command()`` used to implement the custom step internally.

  ``ALWAYS <bool>``
    When enabled, this option specifies that the custom step should always be
    run (i.e. that it is always considered out of date).

  ``EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN <bool>``
    When enabled, this option specifies that the external project's main target
    does not depend on the custom step.

  ``WORKING_DIRECTORY <dir>``
    Specifies the working directory to set before running the custom step's
    command. If this option is not specified, the directory will be the value
    of the ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` at the point where
    ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()`` was called.

  ``LOG <bool>``
    If set, this causes the output from the custom step to be captured to files
    in the external project's ``LOG_DIR`` if supplied or ``STAMP_DIR``.

  ``USES_TERMINAL <bool>``
    If enabled, this gives the custom step direct access to the terminal if
    possible.

  The command line, comment, working directory and byproducts of every
  standard and custom step are processed to replace the tokens
  ``<SOURCE_DIR>``, ``<SOURCE_SUBDIR>``, ``<BINARY_DIR>``, ``<INSTALL_DIR>``
  ``<TMP_DIR>``, ``<DOWNLOAD_DIR>`` and ``<DOWNLOADED_FILE>`` with their
  corresponding property values defined in the original call to
  ``ExternalProject_Add()``.

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets

  The ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` function generates targets for the
  steps listed. The name of each created target will be of the form
  ``<name>-<step>``:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(<name> [NO_DEPENDS] <step1> [<step2>...])

  Creating a target for a step allows it to be used as a dependency of another
  target or to be triggered manually. Having targets for specific steps also
  allows them to be driven independently of each other by specifying targets on
  build command lines. For example, you may be submitting to a sub-project
  based dashboard where you want to drive the configure portion of the build,
  then submit to the dashboard, followed by the build portion, followed
  by tests. If you invoke a custom target that depends on a step halfway
  through the step dependency chain, then all the previous steps will also run
  to ensure everything is up to date.

  If the ``NO_DEPENDS`` option is specified, the step target will not depend on
  the dependencies of the external project (i.e. on any dependencies of the
  ``<name>`` custom target created by ``ExternalProject_Add()``). This is
  usually safe for the ``download``, ``update`` and ``patch`` steps, since they
  do not typically require that the dependencies are updated and built. Using
  ``NO_DEPENDS`` for any of the other pre-defined steps, however, may break
  parallel builds. Only use ``NO_DEPENDS`` where it is certain that the named
  steps genuinely do not have dependencies. For custom steps, consider whether
  or not the custom commands require the dependencies to be configured, built
  and installed.

  Internally, ``ExternalProject_Add()`` calls
  ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()`` to create each step. If any
  ``STEP_TARGETS`` or ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` were specified, then
  ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` will also be called after
  ``ExternalProject_Add_Step()``. ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` have the
  ``NO_DEPENDS`` option set, whereas ``STEP_TARGETS`` do not. Other than that,
  the two options result in ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` being called
  in the same way. Even if a step is not mentioned in either of those two
  options, ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` can still be called later to
  manually define a target for the step.

  The ``STEP_TARGETS`` and ``INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` options for
  ``ExternalProject_Add()`` are generally the easiest way to ensure
  targets are created for specific steps of interest. For custom steps,
  ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()`` must be called explicitly if a target
  should also be created for that custom step. An alternative to these two
  options is to populate the ``EP_STEP_TARGETS`` and
  ``EP_INDEPENDENT_STEP_TARGETS`` directory properties. These act as defaults
  for the step target options and can save having to repeatedly specify the
  same set of step targets when multiple external projects are being defined.

.. command:: ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies

  The ``ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies()`` function can be used to add
  dependencies to a step. The dependencies added must be targets CMake already
  knows about (these can be ordinary executable or library targets, custom
  targets or even step targets of another external project):

  .. code-block:: cmake

    ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(<name> <step> <target1> [<target2>...])

  This function takes care to set both target and file level dependencies and
  will ensure that parallel builds will not break. It should be used instead of
  ``add_dependencies()`` whenever adding a dependency for some of the step
  targets generated by the ``ExternalProject`` module.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

The following example shows how to download and build a hypothetical project
called *FooBar* from github:

 include(ExternalProject)
 ExternalProject_Add(foobar
   GIT_REPOSITORY    git@github.com:FooCo/FooBar.git
   GIT_TAG           origin/release/1.2.3
 )

For the sake of the example, also define a second hypothetical external project
called *SecretSauce*, which is downloaded from a web server. Two URLs are given
to take advantage of a faster internal network if available, with a fallback to
a slower external server. The project is a typical ``Makefile`` project with no
configure step, so some of the default commands are overridden. The build is
only required to build the *sauce* target:

 find_program(MAKE_EXE NAMES gmake nmake make)
 ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
   URL               http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz
                     https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
   URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
   CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
   BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
 )

Suppose the build step of ``secretsauce`` requires that ``foobar`` must already
be built. This could be enforced like so:

 ExternalProject_Add_StepDependencies(secretsauce build foobar)

Another alternative would be to create a custom target for ``foobar``'s build
step and make ``secretsauce`` depend on that rather than the whole ``foobar``
project. This would mean ``foobar`` only needs to be built, it doesn't need to
run its install or test steps before ``secretsauce`` can be built. The
dependency can also be defined along with the ``secretsauce`` project:

 ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(foobar build)
 ExternalProject_Add(secretsauce
   URL               http://intranet.somecompany.com/artifacts/sauce-2.7.tgz
                     https://www.somecompany.com/downloads/sauce-2.7.zip
   URL_HASH          MD5=d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e
   CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
   BUILD_COMMAND     ${MAKE_EXE} sauce
   DEPENDS           foobar-build
 )

Instead of calling ``ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets()``, the target could
be defined along with the ``foobar`` project itself:

 ExternalProject_Add(foobar
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@github.com:FooCo/FooBar.git
   GIT_TAG        origin/release/1.2.3
   STEP_TARGETS   build
 )

If many external projects should have the same set of step targets, setting a
directory property may be more convenient. The ``build`` step target could be
created automatically by setting the ``EP_STEP_TARGETS`` directory property
before creating the external projects with ``ExternalProject_Add()``:

 set_property(DIRECTORY PROPERTY EP_STEP_TARGETS build)

Lastly, suppose that ``secretsauce`` provides a script called ``makedoc`` which
can be used to generate its own documentation. Further suppose that the script
expects the output directory to be provided as the only parameter and that it
should be run from the ``secretsauce`` source directory. A custom step and a
custom target to trigger the script can be defined like so:

 ExternalProject_Add_Step(secretsauce docs
   COMMAND           <SOURCE_DIR>/makedoc <BINARY_DIR>
   WORKING_DIRECTORY <SOURCE_DIR>
   COMMENT           "Building secretsauce docs"
   ALWAYS            TRUE
   EXCLUDE_FROM_MAIN TRUE
 )
 ExternalProject_Add_StepTargets(secretsauce docs)

The custom step could then be triggered from the main build like so::

 cmake --build . --target secretsauce-docs

FeatureSummary
--------------

Functions for generating a summary of enabled/disabled features.

These functions can be used to generate a summary of enabled and disabled
packages and/or feature for a build tree such as::

 -- The following OPTIONAL packages have been found:
 LibXml2 (required version >= 2.4), XML processing lib, <http://xmlsoft.org>
    * Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor
    * Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor
 PNG, A PNG image library., <http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/>
    * Enables saving screenshots
 -- The following OPTIONAL packages have not been found:
 Lua51, The Lua scripting language., <http://www.lua.org>
    * Enables macros in MyWordProcessor
 Foo, Foo provides cool stuff.

Global Properties
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES

The global property ``FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES`` defines the type of
packages used by `FeatureSummary`.

The order in this list is important, the first package type in the list is the
least important, the last is the most important. the of a package can only be
changed to higher types.

The default package types are , ``RUNTIME``, ``OPTIONAL``, ``RECOMMENDED`` and
``REQUIRED``, and their importance is
``RUNTIME < OPTIONAL < RECOMMENDED < REQUIRED``.


.. variable:: FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES

The global property ``FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES`` defines which
package types are required.

If one or more package in this categories has not been found, CMake will abort
when calling ``feature_summary()`` with the
'FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES' option enabled.

The default value for this global property is ``REQUIRED``.


.. variable:: FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE

The global property ``FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE`` defines which
package type is the default one.
When calling ``feature_summary()``, if the user did not set the package type
explicitly, the package will be assigned to this category.

This value must be one of the types defined in the
``FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES`` global property unless the package type
is set for all the packages.

The default value for this global property is ``OPTIONAL``.


.. variable:: FeatureSummary_<TYPE>_DESCRIPTION

The global property ``FeatureSummary_<TYPE>_DESCRIPTION`` can be defined
for each type to replace the type name with the specified string whenever the
package type is used in an output string.

If not set, the string "``<TYPE>`` packages" is used.




Functions
^^^^^^^^^


.. command:: feature_summary

  ::

   feature_summary( [FILENAME <file>]
                    [APPEND]
                    [VAR <variable_name>]
                    [INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES]
                    [FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES]
                    [DESCRIPTION "<description>" | DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION]
                    [QUIET_ON_EMPTY]
                    WHAT (ALL
                         | PACKAGES_FOUND | PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                         | <TYPE>_PACKAGES_FOUND | <TYPE>_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                         | ENABLED_FEATURES | DISABLED_FEATURES)
                  )

 The ``feature_summary()`` macro can be used to print information about
 enabled or disabled packages or features of a project.  By default,
 only the names of the features/packages will be printed and their
 required version when one was specified.  Use ``set_package_properties()``
 to add more useful information, like e.g.  a download URL for the
 respective package or their purpose in the project.

 The ``WHAT`` option is the only mandatory option.  Here you specify what
 information will be printed:

 ``ALL``
  print everything
 ``ENABLED_FEATURES``
  the list of all features which are enabled
 ``DISABLED_FEATURES``
  the list of all features which are disabled
 ``PACKAGES_FOUND``
  the list of all packages which have been found
 ``PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND``
  the list of all packages which have not been found

 For each package type ``<TYPE>`` defined by the
 :variable:`FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES` global property, the following
 information can also be used:

 ``<TYPE>_PACKAGES_FOUND``
  only those packages which have been found which have the type <TYPE>
 ``<TYPE>_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND``
  only those packages which have not been found which have the type <TYPE>

 With the exception of the ``ALL`` value, these values can be combined
 in order to customize the output. For example:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DISABLED_FEATURES)

 If a ``FILENAME`` is given, the information is printed into this file.  If
 ``APPEND`` is used, it is appended to this file, otherwise the file is
 overwritten if it already existed.  If the VAR option is used, the
 information is "printed" into the specified variable.  If ``FILENAME`` is
 not used, the information is printed to the terminal.  Using the
 ``DESCRIPTION`` option a description or headline can be set which will be
 printed above the actual content.  If only one type of
 package was requested, no title is printed, unless it is explicitly set using
 either ``DESCRIPTION`` to use a custom string, or ``DEFAULT_DESCRIPTION`` to
 use a default title for the requested type.
 If ``INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES`` is given, packages which have been searched with
 ``find_package(... QUIET)`` will also be listed. By default they are skipped.
 If ``FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES`` is given, CMake will abort if a
 package which is marked as one of the package types listed in the
 :variable:`FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES` global property has not been
 found.
 The default value for the :variable:`FeatureSummary_REQUIRED_PKG_TYPES` global
 property is ``REQUIRED``.

 The :variable:`FeatureSummary_DEFAULT_PKG_TYPE` global property can be
 modified to change the default package type assigned when not explicitly
 assigned by the user.

 If the ``QUIET_ON_EMPTY`` option is used, if only one type of package was
 requested, and no packages belonging to that category were found, then no
 output (including the ``DESCRIPTION``) is printed or added to the ``VAR``
 variable.

 Example 1, append everything to a file:

 .. code-block:: cmake

  include(FeatureSummary)
  feature_summary(WHAT ALL
                  FILENAME ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/all.log APPEND)

 Example 2, print the enabled features into the variable
 enabledFeaturesText, including QUIET packages:

 .. code-block:: cmake

  include(FeatureSummary)
  feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES
                  INCLUDE_QUIET_PACKAGES
                  DESCRIPTION "Enabled Features:"
                  VAR enabledFeaturesText)
  message(STATUS "${enabledFeaturesText}")

 Example 3, change default package types and print only the categories that
 are not empty:

 .. code-block:: cmake

  include(FeatureSummary)
  set_property(GLOBAL APPEND PROPERTY FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES BUILD)
  find_package(FOO)
  set_package_properties(FOO PROPERTIES TYPE BUILD)
  feature_summary(WHAT BUILD_PACKAGES_FOUND
                  Description "Build tools found:"
                  QUIET_ON_EMPTY)
  feature_summary(WHAT BUILD_PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
                  Description "Build tools not found:"
                  QUIET_ON_EMPTY)

.. command:: set_package_properties

  ::

   set_package_properties(<name> PROPERTIES
                          [ URL <url> ]
                          [ DESCRIPTION <description> ]
                          [ TYPE (RUNTIME|OPTIONAL|RECOMMENDED|REQUIRED) ]
                          [ PURPOSE <purpose> ]
                         )

 Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which
 can then be displayed via FEATURE_SUMMARY().  This can be done either
 directly in the Find-module or in the project which uses the module
 after the find_package() call.  The features for which information can
 be set are added automatically by the find_package() command.

 ``URL <url>``
   This should be the homepage of the package, or something similar.
   Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.

 ``DESCRIPTION <description>``
   A short description what that package is, at most one sentence.
   Ideally this is set already directly in the Find-module.

 ``TYPE <type>``
   What type of dependency has the using project on that package.
   Default is ``OPTIONAL``.  In this case it is a package which can be used
   by the project when available at buildtime, but it also work without.
   ``RECOMMENDED`` is similar to ``OPTIONAL``, i.e.  the project will build if
   the package is not present, but the functionality of the resulting
   binaries will be severely limited.  If a ``REQUIRED`` package is not
   available at buildtime, the project may not even build.  This can be
   combined with the ``FATAL_ON_MISSING_REQUIRED_PACKAGES`` argument for
   ``feature_summary()``.  Last, a ``RUNTIME`` package is a package which is
   actually not used at all during the build, but which is required for
   actually running the resulting binaries.  So if such a package is
   missing, the project can still be built, but it may not work later on.
   If ``set_package_properties()`` is called multiple times for the same
   package with different TYPEs, the ``TYPE`` is only changed to higher
   TYPEs (``RUNTIME < OPTIONAL < RECOMMENDED < REQUIRED``), lower TYPEs are
   ignored.  The ``TYPE`` property is project-specific, so it cannot be set
   by the Find-module, but must be set in the project.
   Type accepted can be changed by setting the
   :variable:`FeatureSummary_PKG_TYPES` global property.

 ``PURPOSE <purpose>``
   This describes which features this package enables in the
   project, i.e.  it tells the user what functionality he gets in the
   resulting binaries.  If set_package_properties() is called multiple
   times for a package, all PURPOSE properties are appended to a list of
   purposes of the package in the project.  As the TYPE property, also
   the PURPOSE property is project-specific, so it cannot be set by the
   Find-module, but must be set in the project.

 Example for setting the info for a package:

 .. code-block:: cmake

   find_package(LibXml2)
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                          DESCRIPTION "A XML processing library."
                          URL "http://xmlsoft.org/")
   # or
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                          TYPE RECOMMENDED
                          PURPOSE "Enables HTML-import in MyWordProcessor")
   # or
   set_package_properties(LibXml2 PROPERTIES
                          TYPE OPTIONAL
                          PURPOSE "Enables odt-export in MyWordProcessor")

   find_package(DBUS)
   set_package_properties(DBUS PROPERTIES
     TYPE RUNTIME
     PURPOSE "Necessary to disable the screensaver during a presentation")

.. command:: add_feature_info

  ::

   add_feature_info(<name> <enabled> <description>)

 Use this macro to add information about a feature with the given ``<name>``.
 ``<enabled>`` contains whether this feature is enabled or not. It can be a
 variable or a list of conditions.
 ``<description>`` is a text describing the feature.  The information can
 be displayed using ``feature_summary()`` for ``ENABLED_FEATURES`` and
 ``DISABLED_FEATURES`` respectively.

 Example for setting the info for a feature:

 .. code-block:: cmake

    option(WITH_FOO "Help for foo" ON)
    add_feature_info(Foo WITH_FOO "The Foo feature provides very cool stuff.")

Legacy Macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following macros are provided for compatibility with previous
CMake versions:

.. command:: set_package_info

  ::

   set_package_info(<name> <description> [ <url> [<purpose>] ])

 Use this macro to set up information about the named package, which
 can then be displayed via ``feature_summary()``.  This can be done either
 directly in the Find-module or in the project which uses the module
 after the :command:`find_package` call.  The features for which information
 can be set are added automatically by the ``find_package()`` command.

.. command:: set_feature_info

  ::

   set_feature_info(<name> <description> [<url>])

 Does the same as::

   set_package_info(<name> <description> <url>)

.. command:: print_enabled_features

  ::

   print_enabled_features()

 Does the same as

 .. code-block:: cmake

   feature_summary(WHAT ENABLED_FEATURES DESCRIPTION "Enabled features:")

.. command:: print_disabled_features

  ::

   print_disabled_features()

 Does the same as

 .. code-block:: cmake

   feature_summary(WHAT DISABLED_FEATURES DESCRIPTION "Disabled features:")

FetchContent
------------------

Overview
^^^^^^^^

This module enables populating content at configure time via any method
supported by the ``ExternalProject`` module.  Whereas
``ExternalProject_Add()`` downloads at build time, the
``FetchContent`` module makes content available immediately, allowing the
configure step to use the content in commands like ``add_subdirectory()``,
``include()`` or ``file()`` operations.

Content population details would normally be defined separately from the
command that performs the actual population.  This separation ensures that
all of the dependency details are defined before anything may try to use those
details to populate content.  This is particularly important in more complex
project hierarchies where dependencies may be shared between multiple projects.

The following shows a typical example of declaring content details:

 FetchContent_Declare(
   googletest
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
 )

For most typical cases, populating the content can then be done with a single
command like so:

 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest)

The above command not only populates the content, it also adds it to the main
build (if possible) so that the main build can use the populated project's
targets, etc.  In some cases, the main project may need to have more precise
control over the population or may be required to explicitly define the
population steps (e.g. if CMake versions earlier than 3.14 need to be
supported).  The typical pattern of such custom steps looks like this:

 FetchContent_GetProperties(googletest)
 if(NOT googletest_POPULATED)
   FetchContent_Populate(googletest)
   add_subdirectory(${googletest_SOURCE_DIR} ${googletest_BINARY_DIR})
 endif()

Regardless of which population method is used, when using the
declare-populate pattern with a hierarchical project arrangement, projects at
higher levels in the hierarchy are able to override the population details of
content specified anywhere lower in the project hierarchy.  The ability to
detect whether content has already been populated ensures that even if
multiple child projects want certain content to be available, the first one
to populate it wins.  The other child project can simply make use of the
already available content instead of repeating the population for itself.
See the :ref:`Examples <fetch-content-examples>` section which demonstrates
this scenario.

The ``FetchContent`` module also supports defining and populating
content in a single call, with no check for whether the content has been
populated elsewhere in the project already.  This is a more low level
operation and would not normally be the way the module is used, but it is
sometimes useful as part of implementing some higher level feature or to
populate some content in CMake's script mode.


Declaring Content Details
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: FetchContent_Declare

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Declare(<name> <contentOptions>...)

  The ``FetchContent_Declare()`` function records the options that describe
  how to populate the specified content, but if such details have already
  been recorded earlier in this project (regardless of where in the project
  hierarchy), this and all later calls for the same content ``<name>`` are
  ignored.  This "first to record, wins" approach is what allows hierarchical
  projects to have parent projects override content details of child projects.

  The content ``<name>`` can be any string without spaces, but good practice
  would be to use only letters, numbers and underscores.  The name will be
  treated case-insensitively and it should be obvious for the content it
  represents, often being the name of the child project or the value given
  to its top level ``project()`` command (if it is a CMake project).
  For well-known public projects, the name should generally be the official
  name of the project.  Choosing an unusual name makes it unlikely that other
  projects needing that same content will use the same name, leading to
  the content being populated multiple times.

  The ``<contentOptions>`` can be any of the download or update/patch options
  that the ``ExternalProject_Add()`` command understands.  The configure,
  build, install and test steps are explicitly disabled and therefore options
  related to them will be ignored.  In most cases, ``<contentOptions>`` will
  just be a couple of options defining the download method and method-specific
  details like a commit tag or archive hash.  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Declare(
      googletest
      GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
      GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
    )

    FetchContent_Declare(
      myCompanyIcons
      URL      https://intranet.mycompany.com/assets/iconset_1.12.tar.gz
      URL_HASH 5588a7b18261c20068beabfb4f530b87
    )

    FetchContent_Declare(
      myCompanyCertificates
      SVN_REPOSITORY svn+ssh://svn.mycompany.com/srv/svn/trunk/certs
      SVN_REVISION   -r12345
    )

Populating The Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For most common scenarios, population means making content available to the
main build according to previously declared details for that dependency.
There are two main patterns for populating content, one based on calling
``FetchContent_GetProperties()`` and
``FetchContent_Populate()`` for more precise control and the other on
calling ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`` for a simpler, more automated
approach.  The former generally follows this canonical pattern:

 # Check if population has already been performed
 FetchContent_GetProperties(<name>)
 string(TOLOWER "<name>" lcName)
 if(NOT ${lcName}_POPULATED)
   # Fetch the content using previously declared details
   FetchContent_Populate(<name>)

   # Set custom variables, policies, etc.
   # ...

   # Bring the populated content into the build
   add_subdirectory(${${lcName}_SOURCE_DIR} ${${lcName}_BINARY_DIR})
 endif()

The above is such a common pattern that, where no custom steps are needed
between the calls to ``FetchContent_Populate()`` and
``add_subdirectory()``, equivalent logic can be obtained by calling
``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()`` instead (and should be preferred where
it meets the needs of the project).

.. command:: FetchContent_Populate

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Populate( <name> )

  In most cases, the only argument given to ``FetchContent_Populate()`` is the
  ``<name>``.  When used this way, the command assumes the content details have
  been recorded by an earlier call to ``FetchContent_Declare()``.  The
  details are stored in a global property, so they are unaffected by things
  like variable or directory scope.  Therefore, it doesn't matter where in the
  project the details were previously declared, as long as they have been
  declared before the call to ``FetchContent_Populate()``.  Those saved details
  are then used to construct a call to ``ExternalProject_Add()`` in a
  private sub-build to perform the content population immediately.  The
  implementation of ``ExternalProject_Add()`` ensures that if the content has
  already been populated in a previous CMake run, that content will be reused
  rather than repopulating them again.  For the common case where population
  involves downloading content, the cost of the download is only paid once.

  An internal global property records when a particular content population
  request has been processed.  If ``FetchContent_Populate()`` is called more
  than once for the same content name within a configure run, the second call
  will halt with an error.  Projects can and should check whether content
  population has already been processed with the
  ``FetchContent_GetProperties()`` command before calling
  ``FetchContent_Populate()``.

  ``FetchContent_Populate()`` will set three variables in the scope of the
  caller; ``<lcName>_POPULATED``, ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` and
  ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR``, where ``<lcName>`` is the lowercased ``<name>``.
  ``<lcName>_POPULATED`` will always be set to ``True`` by the call.
  ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` is the location where the
  content can be found upon return (it will have already been populated), while
  ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR`` is a directory intended for use as a corresponding
  build directory.  The main use case for the two directory variables is to
  call ``add_subdirectory()`` immediately after population, i.e.:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Populate(FooBar ...)
    add_subdirectory(${foobar_SOURCE_DIR} ${foobar_BINARY_DIR})

  The values of the three variables can also be retrieved from anywhere in the
  project hierarchy using the ``FetchContent_GetProperties()`` command.

  A number of cache variables influence the behavior of all content population
  performed using details saved from a ``FetchContent_Declare()`` call:

  ``FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR``
    In most cases, the saved details do not specify any options relating to the
    directories to use for the internal sub-build, final source and build areas.
    It is generally best to leave these decisions up to the ``FetchContent``
    module to handle on the project's behalf.  The ``FETCHCONTENT_BASE_DIR``
    cache variable controls the point under which all content population
    directories are collected, but in most cases developers would not need to
    change this.  The default location is ``${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/_deps``, but if
    developers change this value, they should aim to keep the path short and
    just below the top level of the build tree to avoid running into path
    length problems on Windows.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_QUIET``
    The logging output during population can be quite verbose, making the
    configure stage quite noisy.  This cache option (``ON`` by default) hides
    all population output unless an error is encountered.  If experiencing
    problems with hung downloads, temporarily switching this option off may
    help diagnose which content population is causing the issue.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED``
    When this option is enabled, no attempt is made to download or update
    any content.  It is assumed that all content has already been populated in
    a previous run or the source directories have been pointed at existing
    contents the developer has provided manually (using options described
    further below).  When the developer knows that no changes have been made to
    any content details, turning this option ``ON`` can significantly speed up
    the configure stage.  It is ``OFF`` by default.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED``
    This is a less severe download/update control compared to
    ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED``.  Instead of bypassing all download and
    update logic, the ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED`` only disables the
    update stage.  Therefore, if content has not been downloaded previously,
    it will still be downloaded when this option is enabled.  This can speed up
    the configure stage, but not as much as
    ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED``.  It is ``OFF`` by default.

  In addition to the above cache variables, the following cache variables are
  also defined for each content name (``<ucName>`` is the uppercased value of
  ``<name>``):

  ``FETCHCONTENT_SOURCE_DIR_<ucName>``
    If this is set, no download or update steps are performed for the specified
    content and the ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` variable returned to the caller is
    pointed at this location.  This gives developers a way to have a separate
    checkout of the content that they can modify freely without interference
    from the build.  The build simply uses that existing source, but it still
    defines ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR`` to point inside its own build area.
    Developers are strongly encouraged to use this mechanism rather than
    editing the sources populated in the default location, as changes to
    sources in the default location can be lost when content population details
    are changed by the project.

  ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED_<ucName>``
    This is the per-content equivalent of
    ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED``. If the global option or this option
    is ``ON``, then updates will be disabled for the named content.
    Disabling updates for individual content can be useful for content whose
    details rarely change, while still leaving other frequently changing
    content with updates enabled.


  The ``FetchContent_Populate()`` command also supports a syntax allowing the
  content details to be specified directly rather than using any saved
  details.  This is more low-level and use of this form is generally to be
  avoided in favour of using saved content details as outlined above.
  Nevertheless, in certain situations it can be useful to invoke the content
  population as an isolated operation (typically as part of implementing some
  other higher level feature or when using CMake in script mode):

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_Populate( <name>
      [QUIET]
      [SUBBUILD_DIR <subBuildDir>]
      [SOURCE_DIR <srcDir>]
      [BINARY_DIR <binDir>]
      ...
    )

  This form has a number of key differences to that where only ``<name>`` is
  provided:

  - All required population details are assumed to have been provided directly
    in the call to ``FetchContent_Populate()``. Any saved details for
    ``<name>`` are ignored.
  - No check is made for whether content for ``<name>`` has already been
    populated.
  - No global property is set to record that the population has occurred.
  - No global properties record the source or binary directories used for the
    populated content.
  - The ``FETCHCONTENT_FULLY_DISCONNECTED`` and
    ``FETCHCONTENT_UPDATES_DISCONNECTED`` cache variables are ignored.

  The ``<lcName>_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``<lcName>_BINARY_DIR`` variables are still
  returned to the caller, but since these locations are not stored as global
  properties when this form is used, they are only available to the calling
  scope and below rather than the entire project hierarchy.  No
  ``<lcName>_POPULATED`` variable is set in the caller's scope with this form.

  The supported options for ``FetchContent_Populate()`` are the same as those
  for ``FetchContent_Declare()``.  Those few options shown just
  above are either specific to ``FetchContent_Populate()`` or their behavior is
  slightly modified from how ``ExternalProject_Add()`` treats them.

  ``QUIET``
    The ``QUIET`` option can be given to hide the output associated with
    populating the specified content.  If the population fails, the output will
    be shown regardless of whether this option was given or not so that the
    cause of the failure can be diagnosed.  The global ``FETCHCONTENT_QUIET``
    cache variable has no effect on ``FetchContent_Populate()`` calls where the
    content details are provided directly.

  ``SUBBUILD_DIR``
    The ``SUBBUILD_DIR`` argument can be provided to change the location of the
    sub-build created to perform the population.  The default value is
    ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<lcName>-subbuild`` and it would be unusual
    to need to override this default.  If a relative path is specified, it will
    be interpreted as relative to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``.

  ``SOURCE_DIR``, ``BINARY_DIR``
    The ``SOURCE_DIR`` and ``BINARY_DIR`` arguments are supported by
    ``ExternalProject_Add()``, but different default values are used by
    ``FetchContent_Populate()``.  ``SOURCE_DIR`` defaults to
    ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<lcName>-src`` and ``BINARY_DIR`` defaults to
    ``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<lcName>-build``.  If a relative path is
    specified, it will be interpreted as relative to
    ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``.

  In addition to the above explicit options, any other unrecognized options are
  passed through unmodified to ``ExternalProject_Add()`` to perform the
  download, patch and update steps.  The following options are explicitly
  prohibited (they are disabled by the ``FetchContent_Populate()`` command):

  - ``CONFIGURE_COMMAND``
  - ``BUILD_COMMAND``
  - ``INSTALL_COMMAND``
  - ``TEST_COMMAND``

  If using ``FetchContent_Populate()`` within CMake's script mode, be aware
  that the implementation sets up a sub-build which therefore requires a CMake
  generator and build tool to be available. If these cannot be found by
  default, then the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` and/or
  ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` variables will need to be set appropriately
  on the command line invoking the script.


.. command:: FetchContent_GetProperties

  When using saved content details, a call to ``FetchContent_Populate()``
  records information in global properties which can be queried at any time.
  This information includes the source and binary directories associated with
  the content and also whether or not the content population has been processed
  during the current configure run.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_GetProperties( <name>
      [SOURCE_DIR <srcDirVar>]
      [BINARY_DIR <binDirVar>]
      [POPULATED <doneVar>]
    )

  The ``SOURCE_DIR``, ``BINARY_DIR`` and ``POPULATED`` options can be used to
  specify which properties should be retrieved.  Each option accepts a value
  which is the name of the variable in which to store that property.  Most of
  the time though, only ``<name>`` is given, in which case the call will then
  set the same variables as a call to
  ``FetchContent_Populate(name)``.  This allows
  the following canonical pattern to be used, which ensures that the relevant
  variables will always be defined regardless of whether or not the population
  has been performed elsewhere in the project already:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_GetProperties(foobar)
    if(NOT foobar_POPULATED)
      FetchContent_Populate(foobar)
      ...
    endif()

  The above pattern allows other parts of the overall project hierarchy to
  re-use the same content and ensure that it is only populated once.


.. command:: FetchContent_MakeAvailable

  .. code-block:: cmake

    FetchContent_MakeAvailable( <name1> [<name2>...] )

  This command implements the common pattern typically needed for most
  dependencies.  It iterates over each of the named dependencies in turn
  and for each one it loosely follows the same
  :ref:`canonical pattern <fetch-content-canonical-pattern>` as
  presented at the beginning of this section.  One small difference to
  that pattern is that it will only call ``add_subdirectory()`` on the
  populated content if there is a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file in its top level
  source directory.  This allows the command to be used for dependencies
  that make downloaded content available at a known location but which do
  not need or support being added directly to the build.


Examples
^^^^^^^^

This first fairly straightforward example ensures that some popular testing
frameworks are available to the main build:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   googletest
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/google/googletest.git
   GIT_TAG        release-1.8.0
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   Catch2
   GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2.git
   GIT_TAG        v2.5.0
 )

 # After the following call, the CMake targets defined by googletest and
 # Catch2 will be defined and available to the rest of the build
 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(googletest Catch2)

In more complex project hierarchies, the dependency relationships can be more
complicated.  Consider a hierarchy where ``projA`` is the top level project and
it depends directly on projects ``projB`` and ``projC``.  Both ``projB`` and
``projC`` can be built standalone and they also both depend on another project
``projD``.  ``projB`` additionally depends on ``projE``.  This example assumes
that all five projects are available on a company git server.  The
``CMakeLists.txt`` of each project might have sections like the following:

*projA*:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projB
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projB.git
   GIT_TAG        4a89dc7e24ff212a7b5167bef7ab079d
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projC
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projC.git
   GIT_TAG        4ad4016bd1d8d5412d135cf8ceea1bb9
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projD
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projD.git
   GIT_TAG        origin/integrationBranch
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projE
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projE.git
   GIT_TAG        origin/release/2.3-rc1
 )

 # Order is important, see notes in the discussion further below
 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projD projB projC)

*projB*:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projD
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projD.git
   GIT_TAG        20b415f9034bbd2a2e8216e9a5c9e632
 )
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projE
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projE.git
   GIT_TAG        68e20f674a48be38d60e129f600faf7d
 )

 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projD projE)

*projC*:

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   projD
   GIT_REPOSITORY git@mycompany.com:git/projD.git
   GIT_TAG        7d9a17ad2c962aa13e2fbb8043fb6b8a
 )

 # This particular version of projD requires workarounds
 FetchContent_GetProperties(projD)
 if(NOT projd_POPULATED)
   FetchContent_Populate(projD)

   # Copy an additional/replacement file into the populated source
   file(COPY someFile.c DESTINATION ${projd_SOURCE_DIR}/src)

   add_subdirectory(${projd_SOURCE_DIR} ${projd_BINARY_DIR})
 endif()

A few key points should be noted in the above:

- ``projB`` and ``projC`` define different content details for ``projD``,
  but ``projA`` also defines a set of content details for ``projD``.
  Because ``projA`` will define them first, the details from ``projB`` and
  ``projC`` will not be used.  The override details defined by ``projA``
  are not required to match either of those from ``projB`` or ``projC``, but
  it is up to the higher level project to ensure that the details it does
  define still make sense for the child projects.
- In the ``projA`` call to ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable()``, ``projD``
  is listed ahead of ``projB`` and ``projC`` to ensure that ``projA`` is in
  control of how ``projD`` is populated.
- While ``projA`` defines content details for ``projE``, it does not need
  to explicitly call ``FetchContent_MakeAvailable(projE)`` or
  ``FetchContent_Populate(projD)`` itself.  Instead, it leaves that to the
  child ``projB``.  For higher level projects, it is often enough to just
  define the override content details and leave the actual population to the
  child projects.  This saves repeating the same thing at each level of the
  project hierarchy unnecessarily.


Projects don't always need to add the populated content to the build.
Sometimes the project just wants to make the downloaded content available at
a predictable location.  The next example ensures that a set of standard
company toolchain files (and potentially even the toolchain binaries
themselves) is available early enough to be used for that same build.

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)

 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Declare(
   mycom_toolchains
   URL  https://intranet.mycompany.com//toolchains_1.3.2.tar.gz
 )
 FetchContent_MakeAvailable(mycom_toolchains)

 project(CrossCompileExample)

The project could be configured to use one of the downloaded toolchains like
so:

 cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=_deps/mycom_toolchains-src/toolchain_arm.cmake /path/to/src

When CMake processes the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file, it will download and unpack
the tarball into ``_deps/mycompany_toolchains-src`` relative to the build
directory.  The ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` variable is not used until
the ``project()`` command is reached, at which point CMake looks for the
named toolchain file relative to the build directory.  Because the tarball has
already been downloaded and unpacked by then, the toolchain file will be in
place, even the very first time that ``cmake`` is run in the build directory.

Lastly, the following example demonstrates how one might download and unpack a
firmware tarball using CMake's ``script mode``.  The call to
``FetchContent_Populate()`` specifies all the content details and the
unpacked firmware will be placed in a ``firmware`` directory below the
current working directory.

*getFirmware.cmake*:

 # NOTE: Intended to be run in script mode with cmake -P
 include(FetchContent)
 FetchContent_Populate(
   firmware
   URL        https://mycompany.com/assets/firmware-1.23-arm.tar.gz
   URL_HASH   MD5=68247684da89b608d466253762b0ff11
   SOURCE_DIR firmware
 )

FindPackageHandleStandardArgs
-----------------------------

This module provides a function intended to be used in :ref:`Find Modules`
implementing ``find_package(<PackageName>)`` calls.  It handles the
``REQUIRED``, ``QUIET`` and version-related arguments of ``find_package``.
It also sets the ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable.  The package is
considered found if all variables listed contain valid results, e.g.
valid filepaths.

.. command:: find_package_handle_standard_args

  There are two signatures::

   find_package_handle_standard_args(<PackageName>
     (DEFAULT_MSG|<custom-failure-message>)
     <required-var>...
     )

   find_package_handle_standard_args(<PackageName>
     [FOUND_VAR <result-var>]
     [REQUIRED_VARS <required-var>...]
     [VERSION_VAR <version-var>]
     [HANDLE_COMPONENTS]
     [CONFIG_MODE]
     [REASON_FAILURE_MESSAGE <reason-failure-message>]
     [FAIL_MESSAGE <custom-failure-message>]
     )

 The ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable will be set to ``TRUE`` if all
 the variables ``<required-var>...`` are valid and any optional
 constraints are satisfied, and ``FALSE`` otherwise.  A success or
 failure message may be displayed based on the results and on
 whether the ``REQUIRED`` and/or ``QUIET`` option was given to
 the :command:`find_package` call.

 The options are:

 ``(DEFAULT_MSG|<custom-failure-message>)``
   In the simple signature this specifies the failure message.
   Use ``DEFAULT_MSG`` to ask for a default message to be computed
   (recommended).  Not valid in the full signature.

 ``FOUND_VAR <result-var>``
   Obsolete.  Specifies either ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` or
   ``<PACKAGENAME>_FOUND`` as the result variable.  This exists only
   for compatibility with older versions of CMake and is now ignored.
   Result variables of both names are always set for compatibility.

 ``REQUIRED_VARS <required-var>...``
   Specify the variables which are required for this package.
   These may be named in the generated failure message asking the
   user to set the missing variable values.  Therefore these should
   typically be cache entries such as ``FOO_LIBRARY`` and not output
   variables like ``FOO_LIBRARIES``.

 ``VERSION_VAR <version-var>``
   Specify the name of a variable that holds the version of the package
   that has been found.  This version will be checked against the
   (potentially) specified required version given to the
   :command:`find_package` call, including its ``EXACT`` option.
   The default messages include information about the required
   version and the version which has been actually found, both
   if the version is ok or not.

 ``HANDLE_COMPONENTS``
   Enable handling of package components.  In this case, the command
   will report which components have been found and which are missing,
   and the ``<PackageName>_FOUND`` variable will be set to ``FALSE``
   if any of the required components (i.e. not the ones listed after
   the ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`` option of :command:`find_package`) are
   missing.

 ``CONFIG_MODE``
   Specify that the calling find module is a wrapper around a
   call to ``find_package(<PackageName> NO_MODULE)``.  This implies
   a ``VERSION_VAR`` value of ``<PackageName>_VERSION``.  The command
   will automatically check whether the package configuration file
   was found.

 ``REASON_FAILURE_MESSAGE <reason-failure-message>``
   Specify a custom message of the reason for the failure which will be
   appended to the default generated message.

 ``FAIL_MESSAGE <custom-failure-message>``
   Specify a custom failure message instead of using the default
   generated message.  Not recommended.

Example for the simple signature:

 find_package_handle_standard_args(LibXml2 DEFAULT_MSG
   LIBXML2_LIBRARY LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR)

The ``LibXml2`` package is considered to be found if both
``LIBXML2_LIBRARY`` and ``LIBXML2_INCLUDE_DIR`` are valid.
Then also ``LibXml2_FOUND`` is set to ``TRUE``.  If it is not found
and ``REQUIRED`` was used, it fails with a
``message(FATAL_ERROR)``, independent whether ``QUIET`` was
used or not.  If it is found, success will be reported, including
the content of the first ``<required-var>``.  On repeated CMake runs,
the same message will not be printed again.

Example for the full signature:

 find_package_handle_standard_args(LibArchive
   REQUIRED_VARS LibArchive_LIBRARY LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIR
   VERSION_VAR LibArchive_VERSION)

In this case, the ``LibArchive`` package is considered to be found if
both ``LibArchive_LIBRARY`` and ``LibArchive_INCLUDE_DIR`` are valid.
Also the version of ``LibArchive`` will be checked by using the version
contained in ``LibArchive_VERSION``.  Since no ``FAIL_MESSAGE`` is given,
the default messages will be printed.

Another example for the full signature:

 find_package(Automoc4 QUIET NO_MODULE HINTS /opt/automoc4)
 find_package_handle_standard_args(Automoc4  CONFIG_MODE)

In this case, a ``FindAutmoc4.cmake`` module wraps a call to
``find_package(Automoc4 NO_MODULE)`` and adds an additional search
directory for ``automoc4``.  Then the call to
``find_package_handle_standard_args`` produces a proper success/failure
message.

FindPackageMessage
------------------

 find_package_message(<name> "message for user" "find result details")

This function is intended to be used in FindXXX.cmake modules files.
It will print a message once for each unique find result.  This is
useful for telling the user where a package was found.  The first
argument specifies the name (XXX) of the package.  The second argument
specifies the message to display.  The third argument lists details
about the find result so that if they change the message will be
displayed again.  The macro also obeys the QUIET argument to the
find_package command.

Example:

 if(X11_FOUND)
   find_package_message(X11 "Found X11: ${X11_X11_LIB}"
     "[${X11_X11_LIB}][${X11_INCLUDE_DIR}]")
 else()
  ...
 endif()

FortranCInterface
-----------------

Fortran/C Interface Detection

This module automatically detects the API by which C and Fortran
languages interact.

Module Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables that indicate if the mangling is found:

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_FOUND``
  Global subroutines and functions.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE_FOUND``
  Module subroutines and functions (declared by "MODULE PROCEDURE").

This module also provides the following variables to specify
the detected mangling, though a typical use case does not need
to reference them and can use the Module Functions below.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_PREFIX``
  Prefix for a global symbol without an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SUFFIX``
  Suffix for a global symbol without an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_CASE``
  The case for a global symbol without an underscore,
  either ``UPPER`` or ``LOWER``.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL__PREFIX``
  Prefix for a global symbol with an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL__SUFFIX``
  Suffix for a global symbol with an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_GLOBAL__CASE``
  The case for a global symbol with an underscore,
  either ``UPPER`` or ``LOWER``.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE_PREFIX``
  Prefix for a module symbol without an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE_MIDDLE``
  Middle of a module symbol without an underscore that appears
  between the name of the module and the name of the symbol.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE_SUFFIX``
  Suffix for a module symbol without an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE_CASE``
  The case for a module symbol without an underscore,
  either ``UPPER`` or ``LOWER``.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE__PREFIX``
  Prefix for a module symbol with an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE__MIDDLE``
  Middle of a module symbol with an underscore that appears
  between the name of the module and the name of the symbol.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE__SUFFIX``
  Suffix for a module symbol with an underscore.

``FortranCInterface_MODULE__CASE``
  The case for a module symbol with an underscore,
  either ``UPPER`` or ``LOWER``.

Module Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: FortranCInterface_HEADER

  The ``FortranCInterface_HEADER`` function is provided to generate a
  C header file containing macros to mangle symbol names::

   FortranCInterface_HEADER(<file>
                            [MACRO_NAMESPACE <macro-ns>]
                            [SYMBOL_NAMESPACE <ns>]
                            [SYMBOLS [<module>:]<function> ...])

 It generates in ``<file>`` definitions of the following macros::

    #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL (name,NAME) ...
    #define FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_(name,NAME) ...
    #define FortranCInterface_MODULE (mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...
    #define FortranCInterface_MODULE_(mod,name, MOD,NAME) ...

 These macros mangle four categories of Fortran symbols, respectively:

 * Global symbols without '_': ``call mysub()``
 * Global symbols with '_'   : ``call my_sub()``
 * Module symbols without '_': ``use mymod; call mysub()``
 * Module symbols with '_'   : ``use mymod; call my_sub()``

 If mangling for a category is not known, its macro is left undefined.
 All macros require raw names in both lower case and upper case.

 The options are:

 ``MACRO_NAMESPACE``
   Replace the default ``FortranCInterface_`` prefix with a given
   namespace ``<macro-ns>``.

 ``SYMBOLS``
   List symbols to mangle automatically with C preprocessor definitions::

     <function>          ==> #define <ns><function> ...
     <module>:<function> ==> #define <ns><module>_<function> ...

   If the mangling for some symbol is not known then no preprocessor
   definition is created, and a warning is displayed.

 ``SYMBOL_NAMESPACE``
   Prefix all preprocessor definitions generated by the ``SYMBOLS``
   option with a given namespace ``<ns>``.

.. command:: FortranCInterface_VERIFY

  The ``FortranCInterface_VERIFY`` function is provided to verify
  that the Fortran and C/C++ compilers work together::

   FortranCInterface_VERIFY([CXX] [QUIET])

 It tests whether a simple test executable using Fortran and C (and C++
 when the CXX option is given) compiles and links successfully.  The
 result is stored in the cache entry ``FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_C``
 (or ``FortranCInterface_VERIFIED_CXX`` if ``CXX`` is given) as a boolean.
 If the check fails and ``QUIET`` is not given the function terminates with a
 fatal error message describing the problem.  The purpose of this check
 is to stop a build early for incompatible compiler combinations.  The
 test is built in the ``Release`` configuration.

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 include(FortranCInterface)
 FortranCInterface_HEADER(FC.h MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_")

This creates a "FC.h" header that defines mangling macros ``FC_GLOBAL()``,
``FC_GLOBAL_()``, ``FC_MODULE()``, and ``FC_MODULE_()``.

 include(FortranCInterface)
 FortranCInterface_HEADER(FCMangle.h
                          MACRO_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                          SYMBOL_NAMESPACE "FC_"
                          SYMBOLS mysub mymod:my_sub)

This creates a "FCMangle.h" header that defines the same ``FC_*()``
mangling macros as the previous example plus preprocessor symbols
``FC_mysub`` and ``FC_mymod_my_sub``.

Additional Manglings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FortranCInterface is aware of possible ``GLOBAL`` and ``MODULE`` manglings
for many Fortran compilers, but it also provides an interface to specify
new possible manglings.  Set the variables::

 FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS
 FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS

before including FortranCInterface to specify manglings of the symbols
``MySub``, ``My_Sub``, ``MyModule:MySub``, and ``My_Module:My_Sub``.
For example, the code:

 set(FortranCInterface_GLOBAL_SYMBOLS mysub_ my_sub__ MYSUB_)
   #                                  ^^^^^  ^^^^^^   ^^^^^
 set(FortranCInterface_MODULE_SYMBOLS
     __mymodule_MOD_mysub __my_module_MOD_my_sub)
   #   ^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^     ^^^^^^
 include(FortranCInterface)

tells FortranCInterface to try given ``GLOBAL`` and ``MODULE`` manglings.
(The carets point at raw symbol names for clarity in this example but
are not needed.)

GenerateExportHeader
--------------------

Function for generation of export macros for libraries

This module provides the function ``GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER()``.

The ``GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER`` function can be used to generate a file
suitable for preprocessor inclusion which contains EXPORT macros to be
used in library classes::

 GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER( LIBRARY_TARGET
           [BASE_NAME <base_name>]
           [EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <export_macro_name>]
           [EXPORT_FILE_NAME <export_file_name>]
           [DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <deprecated_macro_name>]
           [NO_EXPORT_MACRO_NAME <no_export_macro_name>]
           [INCLUDE_GUARD_NAME <include_guard_name>]
           [STATIC_DEFINE <static_define>]
           [NO_DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME <no_deprecated_macro_name>]
           [DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED]
           [PREFIX_NAME <prefix_name>]
           [CUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE <variable>]
 )

The target properties ``CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET <<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET>``
and ``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` can be used to add the appropriate
compile flags for targets.  See the documentation of those target properties,
and the convenience variables
``CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` and
``CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN``.

By default ``GENERATE_EXPORT_HEADER()`` generates macro names in a file
name determined by the name of the library.  This means that in the
simplest case, users of ``GenerateExportHeader`` will be equivalent to:

 set(CMAKE_CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET hidden)
 set(CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN 1)
 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib)
 install(TARGETS somelib DESTINATION ${LIBRARY_INSTALL_DIR})
 install(FILES
  someclass.h
  ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/somelib_export.h DESTINATION ${INCLUDE_INSTALL_DIR}
 )

And in the ABI header files:

 #include "somelib_export.h"
 class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass {
   ...
 };

The CMake fragment will generate a file in the
``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}`` called ``somelib_export.h`` containing the
macros ``SOMELIB_EXPORT``, ``SOMELIB_NO_EXPORT``, ``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED``,
``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_EXPORT`` and ``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED_NO_EXPORT``.
They will be followed by content taken from the variable specified by
the ``CUSTOM_CONTENT_FROM_VARIABLE`` option, if any.
The resulting file should be installed with other headers in the library.

The ``BASE_NAME`` argument can be used to override the file name and the
names used for the macros:

 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib
   BASE_NAME other_name
 )

Generates a file called ``other_name_export.h`` containing the macros
``OTHER_NAME_EXPORT``, ``OTHER_NAME_NO_EXPORT`` and ``OTHER_NAME_DEPRECATED``
etc.

The ``BASE_NAME`` may be overridden by specifying other options in the
function.  For example:

 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib
   EXPORT_MACRO_NAME OTHER_NAME_EXPORT
 )

creates the macro ``OTHER_NAME_EXPORT`` instead of ``SOMELIB_EXPORT``, but
other macros and the generated file name is as default:

 add_library(somelib someclass.cpp)
 generate_export_header(somelib
   DEPRECATED_MACRO_NAME KDE_DEPRECATED
 )

creates the macro ``KDE_DEPRECATED`` instead of ``SOMELIB_DEPRECATED``.

If ``LIBRARY_TARGET`` is a static library, macros are defined without
values.

If the same sources are used to create both a shared and a static
library, the uppercased symbol ``${BASE_NAME}_STATIC_DEFINE`` should be
used when building the static library:

 add_library(shared_variant SHARED ${lib_SRCS})
 add_library(static_variant ${lib_SRCS})
 generate_export_header(shared_variant BASE_NAME libshared_and_static)
 set_target_properties(static_variant PROPERTIES
   COMPILE_FLAGS -DLIBSHARED_AND_STATIC_STATIC_DEFINE)

This will cause the export macros to expand to nothing when building
the static library.

If ``DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED`` is specified, then a macro
``${BASE_NAME}_NO_DEPRECATED`` will be defined This macro can be used to
remove deprecated code from preprocessor output:

 option(EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED "Exclude deprecated parts of the library" FALSE)
 if (EXCLUDE_DEPRECATED)
   set(NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED DEFINE_NO_DEPRECATED)
 endif()
 generate_export_header(somelib ${NO_BUILD_DEPRECATED})

And then in somelib:

 class SOMELIB_EXPORT SomeClass
 {
 public:
 #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
   SOMELIB_DEPRECATED void oldMethod();
 #endif
 };

 #ifndef SOMELIB_NO_DEPRECATED
 void SomeClass::oldMethod() {  }
 #endif

If ``PREFIX_NAME`` is specified, the argument will be used as a prefix to
all generated macros.

For example:

 generate_export_header(somelib PREFIX_NAME VTK_)

Generates the macros ``VTK_SOMELIB_EXPORT`` etc.

::

 ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS( [<output_variable>] )

The ``ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS`` function adds ``-fvisibility=hidden`` to
``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS`` if supported, and is a no-op
on Windows which does not need extra compiler flags for exporting support.
You may optionally pass a single argument to ``ADD_COMPILER_EXPORT_FLAGS``
that will be populated with the ``CXX_FLAGS`` required to enable visibility
support for the compiler/architecture in use.

This function is deprecated.  Set the target properties
``CXX_VISIBILITY_PRESET <<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET>`` and
``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` instead.

GetPrerequisites
----------------

Functions to analyze and list executable file prerequisites.

This module provides functions to list the .dll, .dylib or .so files
that an executable or shared library file depends on.  (Its
prerequisites.)

It uses various tools to obtain the list of required shared library
files:

::

 dumpbin (Windows)
 objdump (MinGW on Windows)
 ldd (Linux/Unix)
 otool (Mac OSX)

The following functions are provided by this module:

::

 get_prerequisites
 list_prerequisites
 list_prerequisites_by_glob
 gp_append_unique
 is_file_executable
 gp_item_default_embedded_path
   (projects can override with gp_item_default_embedded_path_override)
 gp_resolve_item
   (projects can override with gp_resolve_item_override)
 gp_resolved_file_type
   (projects can override with gp_resolved_file_type_override)
 gp_file_type

Requires CMake 2.6 or greater because it uses function, break, return
and PARENT_SCOPE.

::

 GET_PREREQUISITES(<target> <prerequisites_var> <exclude_system> <recurse>
                   <exepath> <dirs> [<rpaths>])

Get the list of shared library files required by <target>.  The list
in the variable named <prerequisites_var> should be empty on first
entry to this function.  On exit, <prerequisites_var> will contain the
list of required shared library files.

<target> is the full path to an executable file.  <prerequisites_var>
is the name of a CMake variable to contain the results.
<exclude_system> must be 0 or 1 indicating whether to include or
exclude "system" prerequisites.  If <recurse> is set to 1 all
prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only direct
prerequisites are listed.  <exepath> is the path to the top level
executable used for @executable_path replacment on the Mac.  <dirs> is
a list of paths where libraries might be found: these paths are
searched first when a target without any path info is given.  Then
standard system locations are also searched: PATH, Framework
locations, /usr/lib...

The variable GET_PREREQUISITES_VERBOSE can be set to true to enable verbose
output.

::

 LIST_PREREQUISITES(<target> [<recurse> [<exclude_system> [<verbose>]]])

Print a message listing the prerequisites of <target>.

<target> is the name of a shared library or executable target or the
full path to a shared library or executable file.  If <recurse> is set
to 1 all prerequisites will be found recursively, if set to 0 only
direct prerequisites are listed.  <exclude_system> must be 0 or 1
indicating whether to include or exclude "system" prerequisites.  With
<verbose> set to 0 only the full path names of the prerequisites are
printed, set to 1 extra informatin will be displayed.

::

 LIST_PREREQUISITES_BY_GLOB(<glob_arg> <glob_exp>)

Print the prerequisites of shared library and executable files
matching a globbing pattern.  <glob_arg> is GLOB or GLOB_RECURSE and
<glob_exp> is a globbing expression used with "file(GLOB" or
"file(GLOB_RECURSE" to retrieve a list of matching files.  If a
matching file is executable, its prerequisites are listed.

Any additional (optional) arguments provided are passed along as the
optional arguments to the list_prerequisites calls.

::

 GP_APPEND_UNIQUE(<list_var> <value>)

Append <value> to the list variable <list_var> only if the value is
not already in the list.

::

 IS_FILE_EXECUTABLE(<file> <result_var>)

Return 1 in <result_var> if <file> is a binary executable, 0
otherwise.

::

 GP_ITEM_DEFAULT_EMBEDDED_PATH(<item> <default_embedded_path_var>)

Return the path that others should refer to the item by when the item
is embedded inside a bundle.

Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific
gp_item_default_embedded_path_override function.

::

 GP_RESOLVE_ITEM(<context> <item> <exepath> <dirs> <resolved_item_var>
                 [<rpaths>])

Resolve an item into an existing full path file.

Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific
gp_resolve_item_override function.

::

 GP_RESOLVED_FILE_TYPE(<original_file> <file> <exepath> <dirs> <type_var>
                       [<rpaths>])

Return the type of <file> with respect to <original_file>.  String
describing type of prerequisite is returned in variable named
<type_var>.

Use <exepath> and <dirs> if necessary to resolve non-absolute <file>
values -- but only for non-embedded items.

Possible types are:

::

 system
 local
 embedded
 other

Override on a per-project basis by providing a project-specific
gp_resolved_file_type_override function.

::

 GP_FILE_TYPE(<original_file> <file> <type_var>)

Return the type of <file> with respect to <original_file>.  String
describing type of prerequisite is returned in variable named
<type_var>.

Possible types are:

::

 system

GNUInstallDirs
--------------

Define GNU standard installation directories

Provides install directory variables as defined by the
GNU Coding Standards.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inclusion of this module defines the following variables:

``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``

  Destination for files of a given type.  This value may be passed to
  the ``DESTINATION`` options of ``install()`` commands for the
  corresponding file type.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>``

  The absolute path generated from the corresponding ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``
  value.  If the value is not already an absolute path, an absolute path
  is constructed typically by prepending the value of the
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.  However, there are some
  special cases as documented below.

where ``<dir>`` is one of:

``BINDIR``
  user executables (``bin``)
``SBINDIR``
  system admin executables (``sbin``)
``LIBEXECDIR``
  program executables (``libexec``)
``SYSCONFDIR``
  read-only single-machine data (``etc``)
``SHAREDSTATEDIR``
  modifiable architecture-independent data (``com``)
``LOCALSTATEDIR``
  modifiable single-machine data (``var``)
``RUNSTATEDIR``
  run-time variable data (``LOCALSTATEDIR/run``)
``LIBDIR``
  object code libraries (``lib`` or ``lib64``
  or ``lib/<multiarch-tuple>`` on Debian)
``INCLUDEDIR``
  C header files (``include``)
``OLDINCLUDEDIR``
  C header files for non-gcc (``/usr/include``)
``DATAROOTDIR``
  read-only architecture-independent data root (``share``)
``DATADIR``
  read-only architecture-independent data (``DATAROOTDIR``)
``INFODIR``
  info documentation (``DATAROOTDIR/info``)
``LOCALEDIR``
  locale-dependent data (``DATAROOTDIR/locale``)
``MANDIR``
  man documentation (``DATAROOTDIR/man``)
``DOCDIR``
  documentation root (``DATAROOTDIR/doc/PROJECT_NAME``)

If the includer does not define a value the above-shown default will be
used and the value will appear in the cache for editing by the user.

Special Cases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following values of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` are special:

``/``

  For ``<dir>`` other than the ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR`` and
  ``RUNSTATEDIR``, the value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>`` is prefixed
  with ``usr/`` if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.
  For example, the ``INCLUDEDIR`` value ``include`` becomes ``usr/include``.
  This is required by the GNU Coding Standards, which state:

    When building the complete GNU system, the prefix will be empty
    and ``/usr`` will be a symbolic link to ``/``.

``/usr``

  For ``<dir>`` equal to ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR`` or
  ``RUNSTATEDIR``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` is computed by
  prepending just ``/`` to the value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``
  if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.
  For example, the ``SYSCONFDIR`` value ``etc`` becomes ``/etc``.
  This is required by the GNU Coding Standards.

``/opt/...``

  For ``<dir>`` equal to ``SYSCONFDIR``, ``LOCALSTATEDIR`` or
  ``RUNSTATEDIR``, the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` is computed by
  *appending* the prefix to the value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_<dir>``
  if it is not user-specified as an absolute path.
  For example, the ``SYSCONFDIR`` value ``etc`` becomes ``/etc/opt/...``.
  This is defined by the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

Macros
^^^^^^

.. command:: GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir

  ::

   GNUInstallDirs_get_absolute_install_dir(absvar var)

 Set the given variable ``absvar`` to the absolute path contained
 within the variable ``var``.  This is to allow the computation of an
 absolute path, accounting for all the special cases documented
 above.  While this macro is used to compute the various
 ``CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_<dir>`` variables, it is exposed publicly to
 allow users who create additional path variables to also compute
 absolute paths where necessary, using the same logic.

GoogleTest
----------

This module defines functions to help use the Google Test infrastructure.  Two
mechanisms for adding tests are provided. ``gtest_add_tests()`` has been
around for some time, originally via ``find_package(GTest)``.
``gtest_discover_tests()`` was introduced in CMake 3.10.

The (older) ``gtest_add_tests()`` scans source files to identify tests.
This is usually effective, with some caveats, including in cross-compiling
environments, and makes setting additional properties on tests more convenient.
However, its handling of parameterized tests is less comprehensive, and it
requires re-running CMake to detect changes to the list of tests.

The (newer) ``gtest_discover_tests()`` discovers tests by asking the
compiled test executable to enumerate its tests.  This is more robust and
provides better handling of parameterized tests, and does not require CMake
to be re-run when tests change.  However, it may not work in a cross-compiling
environment, and setting test properties is less convenient.

More details can be found in the documentation of the respective functions.

Both commands are intended to replace use of ``add_test()`` to register
tests, and will create a separate CTest test for each Google Test test case.
Note that this is in some cases less efficient, as common set-up and tear-down
logic cannot be shared by multiple test cases executing in the same instance.
However, it provides more fine-grained pass/fail information to CTest, which is
usually considered as more beneficial.  By default, the CTest test name is the
same as the Google Test name (i.e. ``suite.testcase``); see also
``TEST_PREFIX`` and ``TEST_SUFFIX``.

.. command:: gtest_add_tests

  Automatically add tests with CTest by scanning source code for Google Test
  macros::

   gtest_add_tests(TARGET target
                   [SOURCES src1...]
                   [EXTRA_ARGS arg1...]
                   [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                   [TEST_PREFIX prefix]
                   [TEST_SUFFIX suffix]
                   [SKIP_DEPENDENCY]
                   [TEST_LIST outVar]
   )

 ``gtest_add_tests`` attempts to identify tests by scanning source files.
 Although this is generally effective, it uses only a basic regular expression
 match, which can be defeated by atypical test declarations, and is unable to
 fully "split" parameterized tests.  Additionally, it requires that CMake be
 re-run to discover any newly added, removed or renamed tests (by default,
 this means that CMake is re-run when any test source file is changed, but see
 ``SKIP_DEPENDENCY``).  However, it has the advantage of declaring tests at
 CMake time, which somewhat simplifies setting additional properties on tests,
 and always works in a cross-compiling environment.

 The options are:

 ``TARGET target``
   Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake
   executable target.  CMake will substitute the location of the built
   executable when running the test.

 ``SOURCES src1...``
   When provided, only the listed files will be scanned for test cases.  If
   this option is not given, the :prop_tgt:`SOURCES` property of the
   specified ``target`` will be used to obtain the list of sources.

 ``EXTRA_ARGS arg1...``
   Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.

 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY dir``
   Specifies the directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this
   option is not provided, the current binary directory is used.

 ``TEST_PREFIX prefix``
   Specifies a ``prefix`` to be prepended to the name of each discovered test
   case.  This can be useful when the same source files are being used in
   multiple calls to ``gtest_add_test()`` but with different ``EXTRA_ARGS``.

 ``TEST_SUFFIX suffix``
   Similar to ``TEST_PREFIX`` except the ``suffix`` is appended to the name of
   every discovered test case.  Both ``TEST_PREFIX`` and ``TEST_SUFFIX`` may
   be specified.

 ``SKIP_DEPENDENCY``
   Normally, the function creates a dependency which will cause CMake to be
   re-run if any of the sources being scanned are changed.  This is to ensure
   that the list of discovered tests is updated.  If this behavior is not
   desired (as may be the case while actually writing the test cases), this
   option can be used to prevent the dependency from being added.

 ``TEST_LIST outVar``
   The variable named by ``outVar`` will be populated in the calling scope
   with the list of discovered test cases.  This allows the caller to do
   things like manipulate test properties of the discovered tests.

 .. code-block:: cmake

   include(GoogleTest)
   add_executable(FooTest FooUnitTest.cxx)
   gtest_add_tests(TARGET      FooTest
                   TEST_SUFFIX .noArgs
                   TEST_LIST   noArgsTests
   )
   gtest_add_tests(TARGET      FooTest
                   EXTRA_ARGS  --someArg someValue
                   TEST_SUFFIX .withArgs
                   TEST_LIST   withArgsTests
   )
   set_tests_properties(${noArgsTests}   PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 10)
   set_tests_properties(${withArgsTests} PROPERTIES TIMEOUT 20)

 For backward compatibility, the following form is also supported::

   gtest_add_tests(exe args files...)

 ``exe``
   The path to the test executable or the name of a CMake target.
 ``args``
   A ;-list of extra arguments to be passed to executable.  The entire
   list must be passed as a single argument.  Enclose it in quotes,
   or pass ``""`` for no arguments.
 ``files...``
   A list of source files to search for tests and test fixtures.
   Alternatively, use ``AUTO`` to specify that ``exe`` is the name
   of a CMake executable target whose sources should be scanned.

 .. code-block:: cmake

   include(GoogleTest)
   set(FooTestArgs --foo 1 --bar 2)
   add_executable(FooTest FooUnitTest.cxx)
   gtest_add_tests(FooTest "${FooTestArgs}" AUTO)

.. command:: gtest_discover_tests

  Automatically add tests with CTest by querying the compiled test executable
  for available tests::

   gtest_discover_tests(target
                        [EXTRA_ARGS arg1...]
                        [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
                        [TEST_PREFIX prefix]
                        [TEST_SUFFIX suffix]
                        [NO_PRETTY_TYPES] [NO_PRETTY_VALUES]
                        [PROPERTIES name1 value1...]
                        [TEST_LIST var]
                        [DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT seconds]
   )

 ``gtest_discover_tests`` sets up a post-build command on the test executable
 that generates the list of tests by parsing the output from running the test
 with the ``--gtest_list_tests`` argument.  Compared to the source parsing
 approach of :command:`gtest_add_tests`, this ensures that the full list of
 tests, including instantiations of parameterized tests, is obtained.  Since
 test discovery occurs at build time, it is not necessary to re-run CMake when
 the list of tests changes.
 However, it requires that :prop_tgt:`CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR` is properly set
 in order to function in a cross-compiling environment.

 Additionally, setting properties on tests is somewhat less convenient, since
 the tests are not available at CMake time.  Additional test properties may be
 assigned to the set of tests as a whole using the ``PROPERTIES`` option.  If
 more fine-grained test control is needed, custom content may be provided
 through an external CTest script using the :prop_dir:`TEST_INCLUDE_FILES`
 directory property.  The set of discovered tests is made accessible to such a
 script via the ``<target>_TESTS`` variable.

 The options are:

 ``target``
   Specifies the Google Test executable, which must be a known CMake
   executable target.  CMake will substitute the location of the built
   executable when running the test.

 ``EXTRA_ARGS arg1...``
   Any extra arguments to pass on the command line to each test case.

 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY dir``
   Specifies the directory in which to run the discovered test cases.  If this
   option is not provided, the current binary directory is used.

 ``TEST_PREFIX prefix``
   Specifies a ``prefix`` to be prepended to the name of each discovered test
   case.  This can be useful when the same test executable is being used in
   multiple calls to ``gtest_discover_tests()`` but with different
   ``EXTRA_ARGS``.

 ``TEST_SUFFIX suffix``
   Similar to ``TEST_PREFIX`` except the ``suffix`` is appended to the name of
   every discovered test case.  Both ``TEST_PREFIX`` and ``TEST_SUFFIX`` may
   be specified.

 ``NO_PRETTY_TYPES``
   By default, the type index of type-parameterized tests is replaced by the
   actual type name in the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable
   (e.g. because the type names are unwieldy), this option will suppress this
   behavior.

 ``NO_PRETTY_VALUES``
   By default, the value index of value-parameterized tests is replaced by the
   actual value in the CTest test name.  If this behavior is undesirable
   (e.g. because the value strings are unwieldy), this option will suppress
   this behavior.

 ``PROPERTIES name1 value1...``
   Specifies additional properties to be set on all tests discovered by this
   invocation of ``gtest_discover_tests``.

 ``TEST_LIST var``
   Make the list of tests available in the variable ``var``, rather than the
   default ``<target>_TESTS``.  This can be useful when the same test
   executable is being used in multiple calls to ``gtest_discover_tests()``.
   Note that this variable is only available in CTest.

 ``DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT num``
   Specifies how long (in seconds) CMake will wait for the test to enumerate
   available tests.  If the test takes longer than this, discovery (and your
   build) will fail.  Most test executables will enumerate their tests very
   quickly, but under some exceptional circumstances, a test may require a
   longer timeout.  The default is 5.  See also the ``TIMEOUT`` option of
   :command:`execute_process`.

   .. note::

     In CMake versions 3.10.1 and 3.10.2, this option was called ``TIMEOUT``.
     This clashed with the ``TIMEOUT`` test property, which is one of the
     common properties that would be set with the ``PROPERTIES`` keyword,
     usually leading to legal but unintended behavior.  The keyword was
     changed to ``DISCOVERY_TIMEOUT`` in CMake 3.10.3 to address this
     problem.  The ambiguous behavior of the ``TIMEOUT`` keyword in 3.10.1
     and 3.10.2 has not been preserved.

InstallRequiredSystemLibraries
------------------------------

Include this module to search for compiler-provided system runtime
libraries and add install rules for them.  Some optional variables
may be set prior to including the module to adjust behavior:

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS``
  Specify additional runtime libraries that may not be detected.
  After inclusion any detected libraries will be appended to this.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_SKIP``
  Set to TRUE to skip calling the ``install(PROGRAMS)`` command to
  allow the includer to specify its own install rule, using the value of
  ``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS`` to get the list of libraries.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the debug runtime libraries when available
  with MSVC tools.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEBUG_LIBRARIES_ONLY``
  Set to TRUE to install only the debug runtime libraries with MSVC
  tools even if the release runtime libraries are also available.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_UCRT_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the Windows Universal CRT libraries for
  app-local deployment (e.g. to Windows XP).  This is meaningful
  only with MSVC from Visual Studio 2015 or higher.

  One may set a ``CMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR`` *environment variable*
  to an absolute path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in
  a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain
  ``Redist/ucrt/DLLs/*`` directories.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_MFC_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the MSVC MFC runtime libraries.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_OPENMP_LIBRARIES``
  Set to TRUE to install the MSVC OpenMP runtime libraries

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_DESTINATION``
  Specify the ``install(PROGRAMS)`` command ``DESTINATION``
  option.  If not specified, the default is ``bin`` on Windows
  and ``lib`` elsewhere.

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_LIBS_NO_WARNINGS``
  Set to TRUE to disable warnings about required library files that
  do not exist.  (For example, Visual Studio Express editions may
  not provide the redistributable files.)

``CMAKE_INSTALL_SYSTEM_RUNTIME_COMPONENT``
  Specify the ``install(PROGRAMS)`` command ``COMPONENT``
  option.  If not specified, no such option will be used.

ProcessorCount
--------------

ProcessorCount(var)

Determine the number of processors/cores and save value in ${var}

Sets the variable named ${var} to the number of physical cores
available on the machine if the information can be determined.
Otherwise it is set to 0.  Currently this functionality is implemented
for AIX, cygwin, FreeBSD, HPUX, Linux, macOS, QNX, Sun and
Windows.

This function is guaranteed to return a positive integer (>=1) if it
succeeds.  It returns 0 if there's a problem determining the processor
count.

Example use, in a ctest -S dashboard script:

::

 include(ProcessorCount)
 ProcessorCount(N)
 if(NOT N EQUAL 0)
   set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS -j${N})
   set(ctest_test_args ${ctest_test_args} PARALLEL_LEVEL ${N})
 endif()

This function is intended to offer an approximation of the value of
the number of compute cores available on the current machine, such
that you may use that value for parallel building and parallel
testing.  It is meant to help utilize as much of the machine as seems
reasonable.  Of course, knowledge of what else might be running on the
machine simultaneously should be used when deciding whether to request
a machine's full capacity all for yourself.

SelectLibraryConfigurations
---------------------------

 select_library_configurations(basename)

This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose
good values for the variables

::

 basename_LIBRARY
 basename_LIBRARIES
 basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG
 basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE

depending on what has been found and set.

If only ``basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` is defined, ``basename_LIBRARY`` will
be set to the release value, and ``basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG`` will be set
to ``basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND``.  If only ``basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
is defined, then ``basename_LIBRARY`` will take the debug value, and
``basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE`` will be set to ``basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND``.

If the generator supports configuration types, then ``basename_LIBRARY``
and ``basename_LIBRARIES`` will be set with debug and optimized flags
specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no
build type has been set or the generator in use does not support
configuration types, then ``basename_LIBRARY`` and ``basename_LIBRARIES``
will take only the release value, or the debug value if the release one
is not set.

SquishTestScript
----------------





This script launches a GUI test using Squish.  You should not call the
script directly; instead, you should access it via the SQUISH_ADD_TEST
macro that is defined in FindSquish.cmake.

This script starts the Squish server, launches the test on the client,
and finally stops the squish server.  If any of these steps fail
(including if the tests do not pass) then a fatal error is raised.

TestBigEndian
-------------

Define macro to determine endian type

Check if the system is big endian or little endian

::

 TEST_BIG_ENDIAN(VARIABLE)
 VARIABLE - variable to store the result to

TestForANSIForScope
-------------------

Check for ANSI for scope support

Check if the compiler restricts the scope of variables declared in a
for-init-statement to the loop body.

::

 CMAKE_NO_ANSI_FOR_SCOPE - holds result

TestForANSIStreamHeaders
------------------------

check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI iostream header
(without the .h)

::

 CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STREAM_HEADERS - defined by the results

TestForSSTREAM
--------------

Test for compiler support of ANSI sstream header

check if the compiler supports the standard ANSI sstream header

::

 CMAKE_NO_ANSI_STRING_STREAM - defined by the results

TestForSTDNamespace
-------------------

Test for std:: namespace support

check if the compiler supports std:: on stl classes

::

 CMAKE_NO_STD_NAMESPACE - defined by the results

UseEcos
-------

This module defines variables and macros required to build eCos application.

This file contains the following macros:
ECOS_ADD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES() - add the eCos include dirs
ECOS_ADD_EXECUTABLE(name source1 ...  sourceN ) - create an eCos
executable ECOS_ADJUST_DIRECTORY(VAR source1 ...  sourceN ) - adjusts
the path of the source files and puts the result into VAR

This script create a list of compiled Java class files to be added to
a jar file.  This avoids including cmake files which get created in
the binary directory.

Use Module for Java

This file provides functions for Java.  It is assumed that
``FindJava`` has already been loaded.  See ``FindJava`` for
information on how to load Java into your CMake project.

Creating And Installing JARs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 add_jar(<target_name>
         [SOURCES] <source1> [<source2>...] [<resource1>...]
         [INCLUDE_JARS <jar1> [<jar2>...]]
         [ENTRY_POINT <entry>]
         [VERSION <version>]
         [OUTPUT_NAME <name>]
         [OUTPUT_DIR <dir>]
         [GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS <target> [DESTINATION <dir>]]
         )

This command creates a ``<target_name>.jar``.  It compiles the given
``<source>`` files and adds the given ``<resource>`` files to
the jar file.  Source files can be java files or listing files
(prefixed by ``@``).  If only resource files are given then just a jar file
is created.  The list of ``INCLUDE_JARS`` are added to the classpath when
compiling the java sources and also to the dependencies of the target.
``INCLUDE_JARS`` also accepts other target names created by ``add_jar()``.
For backwards compatibility, jar files listed as sources are ignored (as
they have been since the first version of this module).

The default ``OUTPUT_DIR`` can also be changed by setting the variable
``CMAKE_JAVA_TARGET_OUTPUT_DIR``.

Optionally, using option ``GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS``, native header files can
be generated for methods declared as native.  These files provide the
connective glue that allow your Java and C code to interact.  An INTERFACE
target will be created for an easy usage of generated files.  Sub-option
``DESTINATION`` can be used to specify the output directory for generated
header files.

``GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS`` option requires, at least, version 1.8 of the JDK.

The ``add_jar()`` function sets the following target properties on
``<target_name>``:

``INSTALL_FILES``
  The files which should be installed.  This is used by ``install_jar()``.
``JNI_SYMLINK``
  The JNI symlink which should be installed.  This is used by
  ``install_jni_symlink()``.
``JAR_FILE``
  The location of the jar file so that you can include it.
``CLASSDIR``
  The directory where the class files can be found.  For example to use them
  with ``javah``.

 install_jar(<target_name> <destination>)
 install_jar(<target_name> DESTINATION <destination> [COMPONENT <component>])

This command installs the ``<target_name>`` files to the given
``<destination>``.  It should be called in the same scope as ``add_jar()`` or
it will fail.

The ``install_jar()`` function sets the ``INSTALL_DESTINATION`` target
property on jars so installed.  This property holds the ``<destination>`` as
described above, and is used by ``install_jar_exports()``.  You can get this
information with ``get_property()`` and the ``INSTALL_DESTINATION``
property key.

 install_jni_symlink(<target_name> <destination>)
 install_jni_symlink(<target_name> DESTINATION <destination> [COMPONENT <component>])

This command installs the ``<target_name>`` JNI symlinks to the given
``<destination>``.  It should be called in the same scope as ``add_jar()`` or
it will fail.

 install_jar_exports(TARGETS <jars>...
                     [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
                     FILE <filename>
                     DESTINATION <destination> [COMPONENT <component>])

This command installs a target export file ``<filename>`` for the named jar
targets to the given ``<destination>`` directory.  Its function is similar to
that of ``install(EXPORTS)``.

 export_jars(TARGETS <jars>...
             [NAMESPACE <namespace>]
             FILE <filename>)

This command writes a target export file ``<filename>`` for the named ``<jars>``
targets.  Its function is similar to that of ``export()``.


Examples
""""""""

To add compile flags to the target you can set these flags with the following
variable:

 set(CMAKE_JAVA_COMPILE_FLAGS -nowarn)

To add a path or a jar file to the class path you can do this with the
``CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH`` variable.

 set(CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH /usr/share/java/shibboleet.jar)

To use a different output name for the target you can set it with:

 add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_NAME shibboleet.jar)

To use a different output directory than ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` you can
set it with:

 add_jar(foobar foobar.java OUTPUT_DIR ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/bin)

To define an entry point in your jar you can set it with the ``ENTRY_POINT``
named argument:

 add_jar(example ENTRY_POINT com/examples/MyProject/Main)

To define a custom manifest for the jar, you can set it with the ``MANIFEST``
named argument:

 add_jar(example MANIFEST /path/to/manifest)

To add a version to the target output name you can set it using the ``VERSION``
named argument to ``add_jar()``.  The following example will create a jar file
with the name ``shibboleet-1.0.0.jar`` and will create a symlink
``shibboleet.jar`` pointing to the jar with the version information.

 add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)

If the target is a JNI library, utilize the following commands to
create a JNI symbolic link:

 set(CMAKE_JNI_TARGET TRUE)
 add_jar(shibboleet shibbotleet.java VERSION 1.2.0)
 install_jar(shibboleet ${LIB_INSTALL_DIR}/shibboleet)
 install_jni_symlink(shibboleet ${JAVA_LIB_INSTALL_DIR})

If a single target needs to produce more than one jar from its
java source code, to prevent the accumulation of duplicate class
files in subsequent jars, set/reset ``CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX`` prior
to calling the ``add_jar()`` function:

 set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/foo)
 add_jar(foo foo.java)

 set(CMAKE_JAR_CLASSES_PREFIX com/redhat/bar)
 add_jar(bar bar.java)

For an optimum usage of option ``GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS``, it is recommended to
include module JNI before any call to ``add_jar()``. The produced target for
native headers can then be used to compile C/C++ sources with the
``target_link_libraries()`` command.

 find_package(JNI)
 add_jar(foo foo.java GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS foo-native)
 add_library(bar bar.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(bar PRIVATE foo-native)

Finding JARs
^^^^^^^^^^^^

 find_jar(<VAR>
          <name> | NAMES <name1> [<name2>...]
          [PATHS <path1> [<path2>... ENV <var>]]
          [VERSIONS <version1> [<version2>]]
          [DOC "cache documentation string"]
         )

This command is used to find a full path to the named jar.  A cache
entry named by ``<VAR>`` is created to store the result of this command.
If the full path to a jar is found the result is stored in the
variable and the search will not repeated unless the variable is
cleared.  If nothing is found, the result will be ``<VAR>-NOTFOUND``, and
the search will be attempted again next time ``find_jar()`` is invoked with
the same variable.  The name of the full path to a file that is
searched for is specified by the names listed after ``NAMES`` argument.
Additional search locations can be specified after the ``PATHS`` argument.
If you require special a version of a jar file you can specify it with
the ``VERSIONS`` argument.  The argument after ``DOC`` will be used for the
documentation string in the cache.


Javadoc
^^^^^^^

The ``create_javadoc()`` command can be used to create java documentation
based on files or packages.  For more details please read the javadoc manpage.

There are two main signatures for ``create_javadoc()``.  The first signature
works with package names on a path with source files.

 create_javadoc(<VAR>
                PACKAGES <pkg1> [<pkg2>...]
                [SOURCEPATH <sourcepath>]
                [CLASSPATH <classpath>]
                [INSTALLPATH <install path>]
                [DOCTITLE "the documentation title"]
                [WINDOWTITLE "the title of the document"]
                [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
                )

For example:

 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
   PACKAGES com.example.foo com.example.bar
   SOURCEPATH "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
   CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
   WINDOWTITLE "My example"
   DOCTITLE "<h1>My example</h1>"
   AUTHOR TRUE
   USE TRUE
   VERSION TRUE
 )

The second signature for ``create_javadoc()`` works on a given list of
files.

 create_javadoc(<VAR>
                FILES <file1> [<file2>...]
                [CLASSPATH <classpath>]
                [INSTALLPATH <install path>]
                [DOCTITLE "the documentation title"]
                [WINDOWTITLE "the title of the document"]
                [AUTHOR TRUE|FALSE]
                [USE TRUE|FALSE]
                [VERSION TRUE|FALSE]
               )

For example:

 create_javadoc(my_example_doc
   FILES ${example_SRCS}
   CLASSPATH ${CMAKE_JAVA_INCLUDE_PATH}
   WINDOWTITLE "My example"
   DOCTITLE "<h1>My example</h1>"
   AUTHOR TRUE
   USE TRUE
   VERSION TRUE
 )

Both signatures share most of the options.  These options are the same
as what you can find in the javadoc manpage.  Please look at the
manpage for ``CLASSPATH``, ``DOCTITLE``, ``WINDOWTITLE``, ``AUTHOR``, ``USE``
and ``VERSION``.

If you don't set the ``INSTALLPATH``, then by default the documentation will
be installed to :

::

 ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/share/javadoc/<VAR>

Header Generation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 create_javah(TARGET <target> | GENERATED_FILES <VAR>
              CLASSES <class>...
              [CLASSPATH <classpath>...]
              [DEPENDS <depend>...]
              [OUTPUT_NAME <path>|OUTPUT_DIR <path>]
              )

Create C header files from java classes. These files provide the connective glue
that allow your Java and C code to interact.

.. note::

  This command will no longer be supported starting with version 10 of the JDK
  due to the suppression of javah tool.
  The ``add_jar(GENERATE_NATIVE_HEADERS)`` command should be used instead.

There are two main signatures for ``create_javah()``.  The first signature
returns generated files through variable specified by the ``GENERATED_FILES``
option.  For example:

 create_javah(GENERATED_FILES files_headers
   CLASSES org.cmake.HelloWorld
   CLASSPATH hello.jar
 )

The second signature for ``create_javah()`` creates a target which encapsulates
header files generation. E.g.

 create_javah(TARGET target_headers
   CLASSES org.cmake.HelloWorld
   CLASSPATH hello.jar
 )

Both signatures share same options.

``CLASSES <class>...``
  Specifies Java classes used to generate headers.

``CLASSPATH <classpath>...``
  Specifies various paths to look up classes. Here .class files, jar files or
  targets created by command add_jar can be used.

``DEPENDS <depend>...``
  Targets on which the javah target depends.

``OUTPUT_NAME <path>``
  Concatenates the resulting header files for all the classes listed by option
  ``CLASSES`` into ``<path>``.  Same behavior as option ``-o`` of javah tool.

``OUTPUT_DIR <path>``
  Sets the directory where the header files will be generated.  Same behavior
  as option ``-d`` of javah tool.  If not specified,
  ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` is used as the output directory.

Helper script for UseJava.cmake

UseSWIG
-------

This file provides support for ``SWIG``. It is assumed that ``FindSWIG``
module has already been loaded.

Defines the following command for use with ``SWIG``:

.. command:: swig_add_library

  Define swig module with given name and specified language::

   swig_add_library(<name>
                    [TYPE <SHARED|MODULE|STATIC|USE_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS>]
                    LANGUAGE <language>
                    [NO_PROXY]
                    [OUTPUT_DIR <directory>]
                    [OUTFILE_DIR <directory>]
                    SOURCES <file>...
                   )

 Targets created with the ``swig_add_library`` command have the same
 capabilities as targets created with the :command:`add_library` command, so
 those targets can be used with any command expecting a target (e.g.
 :command:`target_link_libraries`).

 .. note::

   This command creates a target with the specified ``<name>`` when
   policy :policy:`CMP0078` is set to ``NEW``.  Otherwise, the legacy
   behavior will choose a different target name and store it in the
   ``SWIG_MODULE_<name>_REAL_NAME`` variable.

 .. note::

   For multi-config generators, this module does not support
   configuration-specific files generated by ``SWIG``. All build
   configurations must result in the same generated source file.

 ``TYPE``
   ``SHARED``, ``MODULE`` and ``STATIC`` have the same semantic as for the
   :command:`add_library` command. If ``USE_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS`` is specified,
   the library type will be ``STATIC`` or ``SHARED`` based on whether the
   current value of the :variable:`BUILD_SHARED_LIBS` variable is ``ON``. If
   no type is specified, ``MODULE`` will be used.

 ``LANGUAGE``
   Specify the target language.

 ``NO_PROXY``
   Prevent the generation of the wrapper layer (swig ``-noproxy`` option).

 ``OUTPUT_DIR``
   Specify where to write the language specific files (swig ``-outdir``
   option). If not given, the ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` variable will be used.
   If neither is specified, the default depends on the value of the
   ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` variable as follows:

   * If ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` is 1 or is undefined, output is written to
     the :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` directory.
   * If ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` is 2, a dedicated directory will be used.
     The path of this directory can be retrieved from the
     ``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY`` target property.

 ``OUTFILE_DIR``
   Specify an output directory name where the generated source file will be
   placed (swig -o option). If not specified, the ``SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR`` variable
   will be used. If neither is specified, ``OUTPUT_DIR`` or
   ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` is used instead.

 ``SOURCES``
   List of sources for the library. Files with extension ``.i`` will be
   identified as sources for the ``SWIG`` tool. Other files will be handled in
   the standard way. This behavior can be overriden by specifying the variable
   ``SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS``.

 .. note::

   If ``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION`` is set to 2, it is **strongly** recommended
   to use a dedicated directory unique to the target when either the
   ``OUTPUT_DIR`` option or the ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` variable are specified.
   The output directory contents are erased as part of the target build, so
   to prevent interference between targets or losing other important files,
   each target should have its own dedicated output directory.

.. command:: swig_link_libraries

  Link libraries to swig module::

   swig_link_libraries(<name> <item>...)

 This command has same capabilities as :command:`target_link_libraries`
 command.

 .. note::

   If variable ``UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE`` is set to ``STANDARD``, this
   command is deprecated and :command:`target_link_libraries` command must be
   used instead.

Source file properties on module files **must** be set before the invocation
of the ``swig_add_library`` command to specify special behavior of SWIG and
ensure generated files will receive the required settings.

``CPLUSPLUS``
  Call SWIG in c++ mode.  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set_property(SOURCE mymod.i PROPERTY CPLUSPLUS ON)
    swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)

``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  Add custom flags to SWIG compiler and have same semantic as properties
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
  ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``.

``USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
  If set to ``TRUE``, contents of target property
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be forwarded to ``SWIG`` compiler.
  If set to ``FALSE`` target property ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be
  ignored. If not set, target property ``SWIG_USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
  will be considered.

``GENERATED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``GENERATED_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``GENERATED_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  Add custom flags to the C/C++ generated source. They will fill, respectively,
  properties ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
  ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` of generated C/C++ file.

``DEPENDS``
  Specify additional dependencies to the source file.

``SWIG_MODULE_NAME``
  Specify the actual import name of the module in the target language.
  This is required if it cannot be scanned automatically from source
  or different from the module file basename.  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set_property(SOURCE mymod.i PROPERTY SWIG_MODULE_NAME mymod_realname)

  .. note::

 If policy :policy:`CMP0086` is set to ``NEW``, ``-module <module_name>``
 is passed to ``SWIG`` compiler.

Target library properties can be set to apply same configuration to all SWIG
input files.

``SWIG_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``SWIG_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``SWIG_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  These properties will be applied to all SWIG input files and have same
  semantic as target properties ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
  ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set (UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE STANDARD)
    swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)
    set_property(TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS MY_DEF1 MY_DEF2)
    set_property(TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_COMPILE_OPTIONS -bla -blb)

``SWIG_USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
  If set to ``TRUE``, contents of target property
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be forwarded to ``SWIG`` compiler.
  If set to ``FALSE`` or not defined, target property
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will be ignored. This behavior can be
  overridden by specifying source property ``USE_TARGET_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

``SWIG_GENERATED_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``SWIG_GENERATED_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and ``SWIG_GENERATED_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  These properties will populate, respectively, properties
  ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
  ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` of all generated C/C++ files.

``SWIG_DEPENDS``
  Add dependencies to all SWIG input files.

The following target properties are output properties and can be used to get
information about support files generated by ``SWIG`` interface compilation.

``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES``
  This output property list of wrapper files generated during SWIG compilation.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set (UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE STANDARD)
    swig_add_library(mymod LANGUAGE python SOURCES mymod.i)
    get_property(support_files TARGET mymod PROPERTY SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES)

  .. note::

 Only most principal support files are listed. In case some advanced
 features of ``SWIG`` are used (for example ``%template``), associated
 support files may not be listed. Prefer to use the
 ``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY`` property to handle support files.

``SWIG_SUPPORT_FILES_DIRECTORY``
  This output property specifies the directory where support files will be
  generated.

Some variables can be set to customize the behavior of ``swig_add_library``
as well as ``SWIG``:

``UseSWIG_MODULE_VERSION``
  Specify different behaviors for ``UseSWIG`` module.

  * Set to 1 or undefined: Legacy behavior is applied.
  * Set to 2: A new strategy is applied regarding support files: the output
    directory of support files is erased before ``SWIG`` interface compilation.

``CMAKE_SWIG_FLAGS``
  Add flags to all swig calls.

``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR``
  Specify where to write the language specific files (swig ``-outdir`` option).

``SWIG_OUTFILE_DIR``
  Specify an output directory name where the generated source file will be
  placed.  If not specified, ``CMAKE_SWIG_OUTDIR`` is used.

``SWIG_MODULE_<name>_EXTRA_DEPS``
  Specify extra dependencies for the generated module for ``<name>``.

``SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS``
  Specify a list of source file extensions to override the default
  behavior of considering only ``.i`` files as sources for the ``SWIG``
  tool. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set(SWIG_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS ".i" ".swg")

UsewxWidgets
------------

Convenience include for using wxWidgets library.

Determines if wxWidgets was FOUND and sets the appropriate libs,
incdirs, flags, etc.  INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and LINK_DIRECTORIES are
called.

USAGE

::

 # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
 find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED net gl core base)
 include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
 # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
 target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

DEPRECATED

::

 LINK_LIBRARIES is not called in favor of adding dependencies per target.

WriteCompilerDetectionHeader
----------------------------

This module provides the function ``write_compiler_detection_header()``.

This function can be used to generate a file suitable for preprocessor
inclusion which contains macros to be used in source code::

 write_compiler_detection_header(
           FILE <file>
           PREFIX <prefix>
           [OUTPUT_FILES_VAR <output_files_var> OUTPUT_DIR <output_dir>]
           COMPILERS <compiler> [...]
           FEATURES <feature> [...]
           [BARE_FEATURES <feature> [...]]
           [VERSION <version>]
           [PROLOG <prolog>]
           [EPILOG <epilog>]
           [ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS]
           [ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS]
 )

This generates the file ``<file>`` with macros which all have the prefix
``<prefix>``.

By default, all content is written directly to the ``<file>``.  The
``OUTPUT_FILES_VAR`` may be specified to cause the compiler-specific
content to be written to separate files.  The separate files are then
available in the ``<output_files_var>`` and may be consumed by the caller
for installation for example.  The ``OUTPUT_DIR`` specifies a relative
path from the main ``<file>`` to the compiler-specific files. For example:

 write_compiler_detection_header(
   FILE climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
   PREFIX ClimbingStats
   OUTPUT_FILES_VAR support_files
   OUTPUT_DIR compilers
   COMPILERS GNU Clang MSVC Intel
   FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates
 )
 install(FILES
   ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
   DESTINATION include
 )
 install(FILES
   ${support_files}
   DESTINATION include/compilers
 )

``VERSION`` may be used to specify the API version to be generated.
Future versions of CMake may introduce alternative APIs.  A given
API is selected by any ``<version>`` value greater than or equal
to the version of CMake that introduced the given API and less
than the version of CMake that introduced its succeeding API.
The value of the ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION``
variable is used if no explicit version is specified.
(As of CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 there is only one API version.)

``PROLOG`` may be specified as text content to write at the start of the
header. ``EPILOG`` may be specified as text content to write at the end
of the header

At least one ``<compiler>`` and one ``<feature>`` must be listed.  Compilers
which are known to CMake, but not specified are detected and a preprocessor
``#error`` is generated for them.  A preprocessor macro matching
``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_IS_<compiler>`` is generated for each compiler
known to CMake to contain the value ``0`` or ``1``.

Possible compiler identifiers are documented with the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable.
Available features in this version of CMake are listed in the
``CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES`` and
``CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES`` global properties.
The ``{c,cxx}_std_*`` meta-features are ignored if requested.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features.

``BARE_FEATURES`` will define the compatibility macros with the name used in
newer versions of the language standard, so the code can use the new feature
name unconditionally.

``ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILERS`` and ``ALLOW_UNKNOWN_COMPILER_VERSIONS`` cause
the module to generate conditions that treat unknown compilers as simply
lacking all features.  Without these options the default behavior is to
generate a ``#error`` for unknown compilers and versions.

Feature Test Macros
===================

For each compiler, a preprocessor macro is generated matching
``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_IS_<compiler>`` which has the content either ``0``
or ``1``, depending on the compiler in use. Preprocessor macros for
compiler version components are generated matching
``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_MAJOR`` ``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_MINOR``
and ``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_VERSION_PATCH`` containing decimal values
for the corresponding compiler version components, if defined.

A preprocessor test is generated based on the compiler version
denoting whether each feature is enabled.  A preprocessor macro
matching ``<PREFIX>_COMPILER_<FEATURE>``, where ``<FEATURE>`` is the
upper-case ``<feature>`` name, is generated to contain the value
``0`` or ``1`` depending on whether the compiler in use supports the
feature:

 write_compiler_detection_header(
   FILE climbingstats_compiler_detection.h
   PREFIX ClimbingStats
   COMPILERS GNU Clang AppleClang MSVC Intel
   FEATURES cxx_variadic_templates
 )

 #if ClimbingStats_COMPILER_CXX_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES
 template<typename... T>
 void someInterface(T t...) { /* ... */ }
 #else
 // Compatibility versions
 template<typename T1>
 void someInterface(T1 t1) { /* ... */ }
 template<typename T1, typename T2>
 void someInterface(T1 t1, T2 t2) { /* ... */ }

Symbol Macros
=============

Some additional symbol-defines are created for particular features for
use as symbols which may be conditionally defined empty:

 class MyClass ClimbingStats_FINAL
 {
     ClimbingStats_CONSTEXPR int someInterface() { return 42; }
 };

The ``ClimbingStats_FINAL`` macro will expand to ``final`` if the
compiler (and its flags) support the ``cxx_final`` feature, and the
``ClimbingStats_CONSTEXPR`` macro will expand to ``constexpr``
if ``cxx_constexpr`` is supported.

If ``BARE_FEATURES cxx_final`` was given as argument the ``final`` keyword
will be defined for old compilers, too.

The following features generate corresponding symbol defines and if they
are available as ``BARE_FEATURES``:

========================== =================================== ================= ======
        Feature                          Define                      Symbol       bare
========================== =================================== ================= ======
``c_restrict``              ``<PREFIX>_RESTRICT``               ``restrict``      yes
``cxx_constexpr``           ``<PREFIX>_CONSTEXPR``              ``constexpr``     yes
``cxx_deleted_functions``   ``<PREFIX>_DELETED_FUNCTION``       ``= delete``
``cxx_extern_templates``    ``<PREFIX>_EXTERN_TEMPLATE``        ``extern``
``cxx_final``               ``<PREFIX>_FINAL``                  ``final``         yes
``cxx_noexcept``            ``<PREFIX>_NOEXCEPT``               ``noexcept``      yes
``cxx_noexcept``            ``<PREFIX>_NOEXCEPT_EXPR(X)``       ``noexcept(X)``
``cxx_override``            ``<PREFIX>_OVERRIDE``               ``override``      yes
========================== =================================== ================= ======

Compatibility Implementation Macros
===================================

Some features are suitable for wrapping in a macro with a backward
compatibility implementation if the compiler does not support the feature.

When the ``cxx_static_assert`` feature is not provided by the compiler,
a compatibility implementation is available via the
``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT(COND)`` and
``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG(COND, MSG)`` function-like macros. The macros
expand to ``static_assert`` where that compiler feature is available, and
to a compatibility implementation otherwise. In the first form, the
condition is stringified in the message field of ``static_assert``.  In
the second form, the message ``MSG`` is passed to the message field of
``static_assert``, or ignored if using the backward compatibility
implementation.

The ``cxx_attribute_deprecated`` feature provides a macro definition
``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED``, which expands to either the standard
``[[deprecated]]`` attribute or a compiler-specific decorator such
as ``__attribute__((__deprecated__))`` used by GNU compilers.

The ``cxx_alignas`` feature provides a macro definition
``<PREFIX>_ALIGNAS`` which expands to either the standard ``alignas``
decorator or a compiler-specific decorator such as
``__attribute__ ((__aligned__))`` used by GNU compilers.

The ``cxx_alignof`` feature provides a macro definition
``<PREFIX>_ALIGNOF`` which expands to either the standard ``alignof``
decorator or a compiler-specific decorator such as ``__alignof__``
used by GNU compilers.

============================= ================================ ===================== ======
          Feature                          Define                     Symbol          bare
============================= ================================ ===================== ======
``cxx_alignas``                ``<PREFIX>_ALIGNAS``             ``alignas``
``cxx_alignof``                ``<PREFIX>_ALIGNOF``             ``alignof``
``cxx_nullptr``                ``<PREFIX>_NULLPTR``             ``nullptr``           yes
``cxx_static_assert``          ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT``       ``static_assert``
``cxx_static_assert``          ``<PREFIX>_STATIC_ASSERT_MSG``   ``static_assert``
``cxx_attribute_deprecated``   ``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED``          ``[[deprecated]]``
``cxx_attribute_deprecated``   ``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED_MSG``      ``[[deprecated]]``
``cxx_thread_local``           ``<PREFIX>_THREAD_LOCAL``        ``thread_local``
============================= ================================ ===================== ======

A use-case which arises with such deprecation macros is the deprecation
of an entire library.  In that case, all public API in the library may
be decorated with the ``<PREFIX>_DEPRECATED`` macro.  This results in
very noisy build output when building the library itself, so the macro
may be may be defined to empty in that case when building the deprecated
library:

 add_library(compat_support ${srcs})
 target_compile_definitions(compat_support
   PRIVATE
     CompatSupport_DEPRECATED=
 )

Find Modules
^^^^^^^^^^^^

These modules search for third-party software.

 ASPELL_DEFINITIONS - Compiler switches required for using ASPELL

FindAVIFile
-----------

Locate AVIFILE library and include paths

AVIFILE (http://avifile.sourceforge.net/) is a set of libraries for
i386 machines to use various AVI codecs.  Support is limited beyond
Linux.  Windows provides native AVI support, and so doesn't need this
library.  This module defines

::

 AVIFILE_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find avifile.h , etc.
 AVIFILE_LIBRARIES, the libraries to link against
 AVIFILE_DEFINITIONS, definitions to use when compiling
 AVIFILE_FOUND, If false, don't try to use AVIFILE

FindBISON
---------

Find ``bison`` executable and provide a macro to generate custom build rules.

The module defines the following variables:

``BISON_EXECUTABLE``
  path to the ``bison`` program

``BISON_VERSION``
  version of ``bison``

``BISON_FOUND``
  "True" if the program was found

The minimum required version of ``bison`` can be specified using the
standard CMake syntax, e.g.  ``find_package(BISON 2.1.3)``.

If ``bison`` is found, the module defines the macro::

 BISON_TARGET(<Name> <YaccInput> <CodeOutput>
              [COMPILE_FLAGS <flags>]
              [DEFINES_FILE <file>]
              [VERBOSE [<file>]]
              [REPORT_FILE <file>]
              )

which will create a custom rule to generate a parser.  ``<YaccInput>`` is
the path to a yacc file.  ``<CodeOutput>`` is the name of the source file
generated by bison.  A header file is also be generated, and contains
the token list.

The options are:

``COMPILE_FLAGS <flags>``
  Specify flags to be added to the ``bison`` command line.

``DEFINES_FILE <file>``
  Specify a non-default header ``<file>`` to be generated by ``bison``.

``VERBOSE [<file>]``
  Tell ``bison`` to write a report file of the grammar and parser.
  If ``<file>`` is given, it specifies path the report file is copied to.
  ``[<file>]`` is left for backward compatibility of this module.
  Use ``VERBOSE REPORT_FILE <file>``.

``REPORT_FILE <file>``
  Specify a non-default report ``<file>``, if generated.

The macro defines the following variables:

``BISON_<Name>_DEFINED``
  ``True`` is the macro ran successfully

``BISON_<Name>_INPUT``
  The input source file, an alias for <YaccInput>

``BISON_<Name>_OUTPUT_SOURCE``
  The source file generated by bison

``BISON_<Name>_OUTPUT_HEADER``
  The header file generated by bison

``BISON_<Name>_OUTPUTS``
  All files generated by bison including the source, the header and the report

``BISON_<Name>_COMPILE_FLAGS``
  Options used in the ``bison`` command line

Example usage:

 find_package(BISON)
 BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp
              DEFINES_FILE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.h)
 add_executable(Foo main.cpp ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS})

FindBLAS
--------

Find Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) library

This module finds an installed Fortran library that implements the
BLAS linear-algebra interface (see http://www.netlib.org/blas/).  The
list of libraries searched for is taken from the ``autoconf`` macro file,
``acx_blas.m4`` (distributed at
http://ac-archive.sourceforge.net/ac-archive/acx_blas.html).

installation.


FindBacktrace
-------------

Find provider for backtrace(3)_.

Checks if OS supports ``backtrace(3)`` via either ``libc`` or custom library.
This module defines the following variables:

``Backtrace_HEADER``
  The header file needed for ``backtrace(3)``. Cached.
  Could be forcibly set by user.
``Backtrace_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  The include directories needed to use ``backtrace(3)`` header.
``Backtrace_LIBRARIES``
  The libraries (linker flags) needed to use ``backtrace(3)``, if any.
``Backtrace_FOUND``
  Is set if and only if ``backtrace(3)`` support detected.

The following cache variables are also available to set or use:

``Backtrace_LIBRARY``
  The external library providing backtrace, if any.
``Backtrace_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The directory holding the ``backtrace(3)`` header.

Typical usage is to generate of header file using ``configure_file()``
with the contents like the following::

 #cmakedefine01 Backtrace_FOUND
 #if Backtrace_FOUND
 # include <${Backtrace_HEADER}>
 #endif

And then reference that generated header file in actual source.

FindBoost
---------

Find Boost include dirs and libraries

Use this module by invoking find_package with the form::

 find_package(Boost
   [version] [EXACT]      # Minimum or EXACT version e.g. 1.67.0
   [REQUIRED]             # Fail with error if Boost is not found
   [COMPONENTS <libs>...] # Boost libraries by their canonical name
                          # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"
   [OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS <libs>...]
                          # Optional Boost libraries by their canonical name)
   )                      # e.g. "date_time" for "libboost_date_time"

This module finds headers and requested component libraries OR a CMake
package configuration file provided by a "Boost CMake" build.  For the
latter case skip to the "Boost CMake" section below.  For the former
case results are reported in variables::

 Boost_FOUND            - True if headers and requested libraries were found
 Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Boost include directories
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIRS     - Link directories for Boost libraries
 Boost_LIBRARIES        - Boost component libraries to be linked
 Boost_<C>_FOUND        - True if component <C> was found (<C> is upper-case)
 Boost_<C>_LIBRARY      - Libraries to link for component <C> (may include
                          target_link_libraries debug/optimized keywords)
 Boost_VERSION_MACRO    - BOOST_VERSION value from boost/version.hpp
 Boost_VERSION_STRING   - Boost version number in x.y.z format
 Boost_VERSION          - if CMP0093 NEW => same as Boost_VERSION_STRING
                          if CMP0093 OLD or unset => same as Boost_VERSION_MACRO
 Boost_LIB_VERSION      - Version string appended to library filenames
 Boost_VERSION_MAJOR    - Boost major version number (X in X.y.z)
                          alias: Boost_MAJOR_VERSION
 Boost_VERSION_MINOR    - Boost minor version number (Y in x.Y.z)
                          alias: Boost_MINOR_VERSION
 Boost_VERSION_PATCH    - Boost subminor version number (Z in x.y.Z)
                          alias: Boost_SUBMINOR_VERSION
 Boost_VERSION_COUNT    - Amount of version components (3)
 Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS (Windows)
                        - Pass to add_definitions() to have diagnostic
                          information about Boost's automatic linking
                          displayed during compilation

Note that Boost Python components require a Python version suffix
(Boost 1.67 and later), e.g. ``python36`` or ``python27`` for the
versions built against Python 3.6 and 2.7, respectively.  This also
applies to additional components using Python including
``mpi_python`` and ``numpy``.  Earlier Boost releases may use
distribution-specific suffixes such as ``2``, ``3`` or ``2.7``.
These may also be used as suffixes, but note that they are not
portable.

This module reads hints about search locations from variables::

 BOOST_ROOT             - Preferred installation prefix
  (or BOOSTROOT)
 BOOST_INCLUDEDIR       - Preferred include directory e.g. <prefix>/include
 BOOST_LIBRARYDIR       - Preferred library directory e.g. <prefix>/lib
 Boost_NO_SYSTEM_PATHS  - Set to ON to disable searching in locations not
                          specified by these hint variables. Default is OFF.
 Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
                        - List of Boost versions not known to this module
                          (Boost install locations may contain the version)

and saves search results persistently in CMake cache entries::

 Boost_INCLUDE_DIR         - Directory containing Boost headers
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE - Directory containing release Boost libraries
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG   - Directory containing debug Boost libraries
 Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG   - Component <C> library debug variant
 Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE - Component <C> library release variant

The following ``IMPORTED`` targets are also defined::

 Boost::headers                - Target for header-only dependencies
                                 (Boost include directory)
                                 alias: Boost::boost
 Boost::<C>                    - Target for specific component dependency
                                 (shared or static library); <C> is lower-
                                 case
 Boost::diagnostic_definitions - interface target to enable diagnostic
                                 information about Boost's automatic linking
                                 during compilation (adds BOOST_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC)
 Boost::disable_autolinking    - interface target to disable automatic
                                 linking with MSVC (adds BOOST_ALL_NO_LIB)
 Boost::dynamic_linking        - interface target to enable dynamic linking
                                 linking with MSVC (adds BOOST_ALL_DYN_LINK)

Implicit dependencies such as ``Boost::filesystem`` requiring
``Boost::system`` will be automatically detected and satisfied, even
if system is not specified when using ``find_package()`` and if
``Boost::system`` is not added to ``target_link_libraries()``.  If using
``Boost::thread``, then ``Threads::Threads`` will also be added automatically.

It is important to note that the imported targets behave differently
than variables created by this module: multiple calls to
``find_package(Boost)`` in the same directory or sub-directories with
different options (e.g. static or shared) will not override the
values of the targets created by the first call.

Users may set these hints or results as ``CACHE`` entries.  Projects
should not read these entries directly but instead use the above
result variables.  Note that some hint names start in upper-case
"BOOST".  One may specify these as environment variables if they are
not specified as CMake variables or cache entries.

This module first searches for the ``Boost`` header files using the above
hint variables (excluding ``BOOST_LIBRARYDIR``) and saves the result in
``Boost_INCLUDE_DIR``.  Then it searches for requested component libraries
using the above hints (excluding ``BOOST_INCLUDEDIR`` and
``Boost_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS``), "lib" directories near ``Boost_INCLUDE_DIR``,
and the library name configuration settings below.  It saves the
library directories in ``Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG`` and
``Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE`` and individual library
locations in ``Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_DEBUG`` and ``Boost_<C>_LIBRARY_RELEASE``.
When one changes settings used by previous searches in the same build
tree (excluding environment variables) this module discards previous
search results affected by the changes and searches again.

Boost libraries come in many variants encoded in their file name.
Users or projects may tell this module which variant to find by
setting variables::

 Boost_USE_DEBUG_LIBS     - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to search
                            and use the debug libraries.  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_RELEASE_LIBS   - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to search
                            and use the release libraries.  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED  - Set to OFF to use the non-multithreaded
                            libraries ('mt' tag).  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS    - Set to ON to force the use of the static
                            libraries.  Default is OFF.
 Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use
                            libraries linked statically to the C++ runtime
                            ('s' tag).  Default is platform dependent.
 Boost_USE_DEBUG_RUNTIME  - Set to ON or OFF to specify whether to use
                            libraries linked to the MS debug C++ runtime
                            ('g' tag).  Default is ON.
 Boost_USE_DEBUG_PYTHON   - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with a
                            debug Python build ('y' tag). Default is OFF.
 Boost_USE_STLPORT        - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                            STLPort ('p' tag).  Default is OFF.
 Boost_USE_STLPORT_DEPRECATED_NATIVE_IOSTREAMS
                          - Set to ON to use libraries compiled with
                            STLPort deprecated "native iostreams"
                            ('n' tag).  Default is OFF.
 Boost_COMPILER           - Set to the compiler-specific library suffix
                            (e.g. "-gcc43").  Default is auto-computed
                            for the C++ compiler in use.  A list may be
                            used if multiple compatible suffixes should
                            be tested for, in decreasing order of
                            preference.
 Boost_ARCHITECTURE       - Set to the architecture-specific library suffix
                            (e.g. "-x64").  Default is auto-computed for the
                            C++ compiler in use.
 Boost_THREADAPI          - Suffix for "thread" component library name,
                            such as "pthread" or "win32".  Names with
                            and without this suffix will both be tried.
 Boost_NAMESPACE          - Alternate namespace used to build boost with
                            e.g. if set to "myboost", will search for
                            myboost_thread instead of boost_thread.

Other variables one may set to control this module are::

 Boost_DEBUG              - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindBoost.
                            Please enable this before filing any bug report.
 Boost_REALPATH           - Set to ON to resolve symlinks for discovered
                            libraries to assist with packaging.  For example,
                            the "system" component library may be resolved to
                            "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so.1.67.0" instead of
                            "/usr/lib/libboost_system.so".  This does not
                            affect linking and should not be enabled unless
                            the user needs this information.
 Boost_LIBRARY_DIR        - Default value for Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_RELEASE and
                            Boost_LIBRARY_DIR_DEBUG.

On Visual Studio and Borland compilers Boost headers request automatic
linking to corresponding libraries.  This requires matching libraries
to be linked explicitly or available in the link library search path.
In this case setting ``Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS`` to ``OFF`` may not achieve
dynamic linking.  Boost automatic linking typically requests static
libraries with a few exceptions (such as ``Boost.Python``).  Use::

 add_definitions(${Boost_LIB_DIAGNOSTIC_DEFINITIONS})

to ask Boost to report information about automatic linking requests.

Example to find Boost headers only::

 find_package(Boost 1.36.0)
 if(Boost_FOUND)
   include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 endif()

Example to find Boost libraries and use imported targets::

 find_package(Boost 1.56 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
              date_time filesystem iostreams)
 add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 target_link_libraries(foo Boost::date_time Boost::filesystem
                           Boost::iostreams)

Example to find Boost Python 3.6 libraries and use imported targets::

 find_package(Boost 1.67 REQUIRED COMPONENTS
              python36 numpy36)
 add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 target_link_libraries(foo Boost::python36 Boost::numpy36)

Example to find Boost headers and some *static* (release only) libraries::

 set(Boost_USE_STATIC_LIBS        ON)  # only find static libs
 set(Boost_USE_DEBUG_LIBS         OFF) # ignore debug libs and
 set(Boost_USE_RELEASE_LIBS       ON)  # only find release libs
 set(Boost_USE_MULTITHREADED      ON)
 set(Boost_USE_STATIC_RUNTIME    OFF)
 find_package(Boost 1.66.0 COMPONENTS date_time filesystem system ...)
 if(Boost_FOUND)
   include_directories(${Boost_INCLUDE_DIRS})
   add_executable(foo foo.cc)
   target_link_libraries(foo ${Boost_LIBRARIES})
 endif()

Boost CMake
^^^^^^^^^^^

If Boost was built using the boost-cmake project or from Boost 1.70.0 on
it provides a package configuration file for use with find_package's config mode.
This module looks for the package configuration file called
``BoostConfig.cmake`` or ``boost-config.cmake`` and stores the result in
``CACHE`` entry "Boost_DIR".  If found, the package configuration file is loaded
and this module returns with no further action.  See documentation of
the Boost CMake package configuration for details on what it provides.

Set ``Boost_NO_BOOST_CMAKE`` to ``ON``, to disable the search for boost-cmake.

::

 #=============
 Example foo_test.h:

::

 #include <cxxtest/TestSuite.h>

::

 class MyTestSuite : public CxxTest::TestSuite
 {
 public:
    void testAddition( void )
    {
       TS_ASSERT( 1 + 1 > 1 );
       TS_ASSERT_EQUALS( 1 + 1, 2 );
    }
 };

FindCygwin
----------

Find Cygwin, a POSIX-compatible environment that runs natively
on Microsoft Windows

FindDart
--------

Find DART

This module looks for the dart testing software and sets DART_ROOT to
point to where it found it.

FindDCMTK
---------

Find DICOM ToolKit (DCMTK) libraries and applications

The module defines the following variables::

 DCMTK_INCLUDE_DIRS  - Directories to include to use DCMTK
 DCMTK_LIBRARIES     - Files to link against to use DCMTK
 DCMTK_FOUND         - If false, don't try to use DCMTK
 DCMTK_DIR           - (optional) Source directory for DCMTK

Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module is able to find a version of DCMTK that does or does not export
a *DCMTKConfig.cmake* file. It applies a two step process:

* Step 1:  Attempt to find DCMTK version providing a *DCMTKConfig.cmake* file.
* Step 2:  If step 1 failed, rely on *FindDCMTK.cmake* to set `DCMTK_*` variables details below.


`Recent DCMTK
<http://git.dcmtk.org/web?p=dcmtk.git;a=commit;h=662ae187c493c6b9a73dd5e3875372cebd0c11fe>`_
provides a *DCMTKConfig.cmake* :manual:`package configuration file
<cmake-packages(7)>`. To exclusively use the package configuration file
(recommended when possible), pass the `NO_MODULE` option to
``find_package()``. For example, `find_package(DCMTK NO_MODULE)`.
This requires official DCMTK snapshot *3.6.1_20140617* or newer.


Until all clients update to the more recent DCMTK, build systems will need
to support different versions of DCMTK.

On any given system, the following combinations of DCMTK versions could be
considered:

+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
|        |   SYSTEM DCMTK      |      LOCAL DCMTK      |     Supported ?   |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case A |   NA                |      [ ] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case B |   NA                |      [X] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case C |   [ ] DCMTKConfig   |      NA               |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case D |   [X] DCMTKConfig   |      NA               |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case E |   [ ] DCMTKConfig   |      [ ] DCMTKConfig  |         YES (*)   |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case F |   [X] DCMTKConfig   |      [ ] DCMTKConfig  |         NO        |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case G |   [ ] DCMTKConfig   |      [X] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+
| Case H |   [X] DCMTKConfig   |      [X] DCMTKConfig  |         YES       |
+--------+---------------------+-----------------------+-------------------+

 (*) See Troubleshooting section.

Legend:

  NA ...............: Means that no System or Local DCMTK is available

  [ ] DCMTKConfig ..: Means that the version of DCMTK does NOT export a DCMTKConfig.cmake file.

  [X] DCMTKConfig ..: Means that the version of DCMTK exports a DCMTKConfig.cmake file.


Troubleshooting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

What to do if my project finds a different version of DCMTK?

Remove DCMTK entry from the CMake cache per ``find_package()``
documentation.

FindDevIL
---------



This module locates the developer's image library.
http://openil.sourceforge.net/

This module sets:

::

 IL_LIBRARIES -   the name of the IL library. These include the full path to
                  the core DevIL library. This one has to be linked into the
                  application.
 ILU_LIBRARIES -  the name of the ILU library. Again, the full path. This
                  library is for filters and effects, not actual loading. It
                  doesn't have to be linked if the functionality it provides
                  is not used.
 ILUT_LIBRARIES - the name of the ILUT library. Full path. This part of the
                  library interfaces with OpenGL. It is not strictly needed
                  in applications.
 IL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find the il.h, ilu.h and ilut.h files.
 DevIL_FOUND    - this is set to TRUE if all the above variables were set.
                  This will be set to false if ILU or ILUT are not found,
                  even if they are not needed. In most systems, if one
                  library is found all the others are as well. That's the
                  way the DevIL developers release it.

FindDoxygen
-----------

Doxygen is a documentation generation tool (see http://www.doxygen.org).
This module looks for Doxygen and some optional tools it supports. These
tools are enabled as components in the ``find_package()`` command:

``dot``
  Graphviz ``dot`` utility used to render various
  graphs.
``mscgen``
  Message Chart Generator utility used
  by Doxygen's ``\msc`` and ``\mscfile`` commands.
``dia``
  Dia the diagram editor used by Doxygen's
  ``\diafile`` command.

Examples:

 # Require dot, treat the other components as optional
 find_package(Doxygen
              REQUIRED dot
              OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS mscgen dia)

The following variables are defined by this module:

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_FOUND

  True if the ``doxygen`` executable was found.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_VERSION

  The version reported by ``doxygen --version``.

The module defines ``IMPORTED`` targets for Doxygen and each component found.
These can be used as part of custom commands, etc. and should be preferred over
old-style (and now deprecated) variables like ``DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE``. The
following import targets are defined if their corresponding executable could be
found (the component import targets will only be defined if that component was
requested):

::

 Doxygen::doxygen
 Doxygen::dot
 Doxygen::mscgen
 Doxygen::dia

Functions
^^^^^^^^^

.. command:: doxygen_add_docs

  This function is intended as a convenience for adding a target for generating
  documentation with Doxygen. It aims to provide sensible defaults so that
  projects can generally just provide the input files and directories and that
  will be sufficient to give sensible results. The function supports the
  ability to customize the Doxygen configuration used to build the
  documentation.

  ::

   doxygen_add_docs(targetName
       [filesOrDirs...]
       [ALL]
       [USE_STAMP_FILE]
       [WORKING_DIRECTORY dir]
       [COMMENT comment])

 The function constructs a ``Doxyfile`` and defines a custom target that runs
 Doxygen on that generated file. The listed files and directories are used as
 the ``INPUT`` of the generated ``Doxyfile`` and they can contain wildcards.
 Any files that are listed explicitly will also be added as ``SOURCES`` of the
 custom target so they will show up in an IDE project's source list.

 So that relative input paths work as expected, by default the working
 directory of the Doxygen command will be the current source directory (i.e.
 :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`). This can be overridden with the
 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` option to change the directory used as the relative
 base point. Note also that Doxygen's default behavior is to strip the working
 directory from relative paths in the generated documentation (see the
 ``STRIP_FROM_PATH`` `Doxygen config option
 <http://www.doxygen.org/manual/config.html>`_ for details).

 If provided, the optional ``comment`` will be passed as the ``COMMENT`` for
 the :command:`add_custom_target` command used to create the custom target
 internally.

 If ``ALL`` is set, the target will be added to the default build target.

 If ``USE_STAMP_FILE`` is set, the custom command defined by this function will
 create a stamp file with the name ``<targetName>.stamp`` in the current
 binary directory whenever doxygen is re-run.  With this option present, all
 items in ``<filesOrDirs>`` must be files (i.e. no directories, symlinks or
 wildcards) and each of the files must exist at the time
 ``doxygen_add_docs()`` is called.  An error will be raised if any of the
 items listed is missing or is not a file when ``USE_STAMP_FILE`` is given.
 A dependency will be created on each of the files so that doxygen will only
 be re-run if one of the files is updated.  Without the ``USE_STAMP_FILE``
 option, doxygen will always be re-run if the ``<targetName>`` target is built
 regardless of whether anything listed in ``<filesOrDirs>`` has changed.

 The contents of the generated ``Doxyfile`` can be customized by setting CMake
 variables before calling ``doxygen_add_docs()``. Any variable with a name of
 the form ``DOXYGEN_<tag>`` will have its value substituted for the
 corresponding ``<tag>`` configuration option in the ``Doxyfile``. See the
 `Doxygen documentation <http://www.doxygen.org/manual/config.html>`_ for the
 full list of supported configuration options.

 Some of Doxygen's defaults are overridden to provide more appropriate
 behavior for a CMake project. Each of the following will be explicitly set
 unless the variable already has a value before ``doxygen_add_docs()`` is
 called (with some exceptions noted):

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT

   Set to ``YES`` if the ``dot`` component was requested and it was found,
   ``NO`` otherwise. Any existing value of ``DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT`` is ignored.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_MULTI_TARGETS

   Set to ``YES`` by this module (note that this requires a ``dot`` version
   newer than 1.8.10). This option is only meaningful if ``DOXYGEN_HAVE_DOT``
   is also set to ``YES``.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_GENERATE_LATEX

   Set to ``NO`` by this module.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_WARN_FORMAT

   For Visual Studio based generators, this is set to the form recognized by
   the Visual Studio IDE: ``$file($line) : $text``. For all other generators,
   Doxygen's default value is not overridden.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NAME

   Populated with the name of the current project (i.e.
   :variable:`PROJECT_NAME`).

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_PROJECT_NUMBER

   Populated with the version of the current project (i.e.
   :variable:`PROJECT_VERSION`).

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF

   Populated with the description of the current project (i.e.
   :variable:`PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`).

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_INPUT

   Projects should not set this variable. It will be populated with the set of
   files and directories passed to ``doxygen_add_docs()``, thereby providing
   consistent behavior with the other built-in commands like
   :command:`add_executable`, :command:`add_library` and
   :command:`add_custom_target`. If a variable named ``DOXYGEN_INPUT`` is set
   by the project, it will be ignored and a warning will be issued.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_RECURSIVE

   Set to ``YES`` by this module.

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS

   If the set of inputs includes directories, this variable will specify
   patterns used to exclude files from them. The following patterns are added
   by ``doxygen_add_docs()`` to ensure CMake-specific files and directories
   are not included in the input. If the project sets
   ``DOXYGEN_EXCLUDE_PATTERNS``, those contents are merged with these
   additional patterns rather than replacing them:

   ::

     */.git/*
     */.svn/*
     */.hg/*
     */CMakeFiles/*
     */_CPack_Packages/*
     DartConfiguration.tcl
     CMakeLists.txt
     CMakeCache.txt

 .. variable:: DOXYGEN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

   Set to :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` by this module. Note that if
   the project provides its own value for this and it is a relative path, it
   will be converted to an absolute path relative to the current binary
   directory. This is necessary because doxygen will normally be run from a
   directory within the source tree so that relative source paths work as
   expected. If this directory does not exist, it will be recursively created
   prior to executing the doxygen commands.

To change any of these defaults or override any other Doxygen config option,
set relevant variables before calling ``doxygen_add_docs()``. For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_HTML NO)
    set(DOXYGEN_GENERATE_MAN YES)

    doxygen_add_docs(
        doxygen
        ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}
        COMMENT "Generate man pages"
    )

A number of Doxygen config options accept lists of values, but Doxygen requires
them to be separated by whitespace. CMake variables hold lists as a string with
items separated by semi-colons, so a conversion needs to be performed. The
``doxygen_add_docs()`` command specifically checks the following Doxygen config
options and will convert their associated CMake variable's contents into the
required form if set.

There are situations where it may be undesirable for a particular config option
to be automatically quoted by ``doxygen_add_docs()``, such as ``ALIASES`` which
may need to include its own embedded quoting.  The ``DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS``
variable can be used to specify a list of Doxygen variables (including the
leading ``DOXYGEN_`` prefix) which should not be quoted.  The project is then
responsible for ensuring that those variables' values make sense when placed
directly in the Doxygen input file.  In the case of list variables, list items
are still separated by spaces, it is only the automatic quoting that is
skipped.  For example, the following allows ``doxygen_add_docs()`` to apply
quoting to ``DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF``, but not each item in the
``DOXYGEN_ALIASES`` list (:ref:`bracket syntax <Bracket Argument>` can also
be used to make working with embedded quotes easier):

 set(DOXYGEN_PROJECT_BRIEF "String with spaces")
 set(DOXYGEN_ALIASES
     [[somealias="@some_command param"]]
     "anotherAlias=@foobar"
 )
 set(DOXYGEN_VERBATIM_VARS DOXYGEN_ALIASES)

The resultant ``Doxyfile`` will contain the following lines:

 PROJECT_BRIEF = "String with spaces"
 ALIASES       = somealias="@some_command param" anotherAlias=@foobar

Deprecated Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For compatibility with previous versions of CMake, the following variables
are also defined but they are deprecated and should no longer be used:

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_EXECUTABLE

  The path to the ``doxygen`` command. If projects need to refer to the
  ``doxygen`` executable directly, they should use the ``Doxygen::doxygen``
  import target instead.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_FOUND

  True if the ``dot`` executable was found.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE

  The path to the ``dot`` command. If projects need to refer to the ``dot``
  executable directly, they should use the ``Doxygen::dot`` import target
  instead.

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_DOT_PATH

  The path to the directory containing the ``dot`` executable as reported in
  ``DOXYGEN_DOT_EXECUTABLE``. The path may have forward slashes even on Windows
  and is not suitable for direct substitution into a ``Doxyfile.in`` template.
  If you need this value, get the ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` property of the
  ``Doxygen::dot`` target and use ``get_filename_component()`` to extract
  the directory part of that path. You may also want to consider using
  ``file(TO_NATIVE_PATH)`` to prepare the path for a Doxygen
  configuration file.


Deprecated Hint Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: DOXYGEN_SKIP_DOT

  This variable has no effect for the component form of ``find_package``.
  In backward compatibility mode (i.e. without components list) it prevents
  the finder module from searching for Graphviz's ``dot`` utility.


FindEnvModules
--------------

Locate an environment module implementation and make commands available to
CMake scripts to use them.  This is compatible with both Lua-based Lmod
and TCL-based EnvironmentModules.

This module is intended for the use case of setting up the compiler and library
environment within a :ref:`CTest Script <CTest Script>` (``ctest -S``).  It can
also be used in a :ref:`CMake Script <Script Processing Mode>` (``cmake -P``).

.. note::

  The loaded environment will not survive past the end of the calling process.
  Do not use this module in project code (``CMakeLists.txt`` files) to load
  a compiler environment; it will not be available during the build.  Instead
  load the environment manually before running CMake or using the generated
  build system.

Example Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

 set(CTEST_BUILD_NAME "CrayLinux-CrayPE-Cray-dynamic")
 set(CTEST_BUILD_CONFIGURATION Release)
 set(CTEST_BUILD_FLAGS "-k -j8")
 set(CTEST_CMAKE_GENERATOR "Unix Makefiles")

 ...

 find_package(EnvModules REQUIRED)

 env_module(purge)
 env_module(load modules)
 env_module(load craype)
 env_module(load PrgEnv-cray)
 env_module(load craype-knl)
 env_module(load cray-mpich)
 env_module(load cray-libsci)

 set(ENV{CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE} dynamic)

 ...

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``EnvModules_FOUND``
  True if a compatible environment modules framework was found.

Cache Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variable will be set:

``EnvModules_COMMAND``
  The low level module command to use.  Currently supported
  implementations are the Lua based Lmod and TCL based EnvironmentModules.

Environment Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``ENV{MODULESHOME}``
  Usually set by the module environment implementation, used as a hint to
  locate the module command to execute.

Provided Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This defines the following CMake functions for interacting with environment
modules:

.. command:: env_module

  Execute an aribitrary module command:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    env_module(cmd arg1 ... argN)
    env_module(
      COMMAND cmd arg1 ... argN
      [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <out-var>]
      [RESULT_VARIABLE <ret-var>]
    )

  The options are:

  ``cmd arg1 ... argN``
    The module sub-command and arguments to execute as if they were
    passed directly to the module command in your shell environment.

  ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <out-var>``
    The standard output from executing the module command.

  ``RESULT_VARIABLE <ret-var>``
    The return code from executing the module command.

.. command:: env_module_swap

  Swap one module for another:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    env_module_swap(out_mod in_mod
      [OUTPUT_VARIABLE <out-var>]
      [RESULT_VARIABLE <ret-var>]
    )

  This is functionally equivalent to the ``module swap out_mod in_mod`` shell
  command.  The options are:

  ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE <out-var>``
    The standard output from executing the module command.

  ``RESULT_VARIABLE <ret-var>``
    The return code from executing the module command.

.. command:: env_module_list

  Retrieve the list of currently loaded modules:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    env_module_list(<out-var>)

  This is functionally equivalent to the ``module list`` shell command.
  The result is stored in ``<out-var>`` as a properly formatted CMake
  :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` variable.

.. command:: env_module_avail

  Retrieve the list of available modules:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    env_module_avail([<mod-prefix>] <out-var>)

  This is functionally equivalent to the ``module avail <mod-prefix>`` shell
  command.  The result is stored in ``<out-var>`` as a properly formatted
  CMake :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` variable.


FindEXPAT
---------

Find the native Expat headers and library.
Expat is a stream-oriented XML parser library written in C.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``EXPAT::EXPAT``
  The Expat ``expat`` library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``EXPAT_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find expat.h, etc.
``EXPAT_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use Expat.
``EXPAT_FOUND``
  true if the Expat headers and libraries were found.


FindFLEX
--------

Find Fast Lexical Analyzer (Flex) executable and provides a macro
to generate custom build rules



The module defines the following variables:

::

 FLEX_FOUND - True is flex executable is found
 FLEX_EXECUTABLE - the path to the flex executable
 FLEX_VERSION - the version of flex
 FLEX_LIBRARIES - The flex libraries
 FLEX_INCLUDE_DIRS - The path to the flex headers

The minimum required version of flex can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.  ``find_package(FLEX 2.5.13)``



If flex is found on the system, the module provides the macro:

::

 FLEX_TARGET(Name FlexInput FlexOutput
             [COMPILE_FLAGS <string>]
             [DEFINES_FILE <string>]
             )

which creates a custom command to generate the ``FlexOutput`` file from
the ``FlexInput`` file.  If ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` option is specified, the next
parameter is added to the flex command line. If flex is configured to
output a header file, the ``DEFINES_FILE`` option may be used to specify its
name. Name is an alias used to get details of this custom command.
Indeed the macro defines the following variables:

::

 FLEX_${Name}_DEFINED - true is the macro ran successfully
 FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUTS - the source file generated by the custom rule, an
 alias for FlexOutput
 FLEX_${Name}_INPUT - the flex source file, an alias for ${FlexInput}
 FLEX_${Name}_OUTPUT_HEADER - the header flex output, if any.

Flex scanners often use tokens defined by Bison: the code generated
by Flex depends of the header generated by Bison.  This module also
defines a macro:

::

 ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(FlexTarget BisonTarget)

which adds the required dependency between a scanner and a parser
where ``FlexTarget`` and ``BisonTarget`` are the first parameters of
respectively ``FLEX_TARGET`` and ``BISON_TARGET`` macros.

::

 ====================================================================
 Example:

::

 find_package(BISON)
 find_package(FLEX)

::

 BISON_TARGET(MyParser parser.y ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/parser.cpp)
 FLEX_TARGET(MyScanner lexer.l  ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/lexer.cpp)
 ADD_FLEX_BISON_DEPENDENCY(MyScanner MyParser)

::

  include_directories(${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR})
  add_executable(Foo
     Foo.cc
     ${BISON_MyParser_OUTPUTS}
     ${FLEX_MyScanner_OUTPUTS}
  )
  target_link_libraries(Foo ${FLEX_LIBRARIES})
 ====================================================================

FindGTK2
--------

Find the GTK2 widget libraries and several of its
other optional components like ``gtkmm``, ``glade``, and ``glademm``.

NOTE: If you intend to use version checking, CMake 2.6.2 or later is

::

 required.

Specify one or more of the following components as you call this find
module.  See example below.

::

 gtk
 gtkmm
 glade
 glademm

The following variables will be defined for your use

::

 GTK2_FOUND - Were all of your specified components found?
 GTK2_INCLUDE_DIRS - All include directories
 GTK2_LIBRARIES - All libraries
 GTK2_TARGETS - All imported targets
 GTK2_DEFINITIONS - Additional compiler flags

::

 GTK2_VERSION - The version of GTK2 found (x.y.z)
 GTK2_MAJOR_VERSION - The major version of GTK2
 GTK2_MINOR_VERSION - The minor version of GTK2
 GTK2_PATCH_VERSION - The patch version of GTK2

Optional variables you can define prior to calling this module:

::

 GTK2_DEBUG - Enables verbose debugging of the module
 GTK2_ADDITIONAL_SUFFIXES - Allows defining additional directories to
                            search for include files

================= Example Usage:

::

 Call find_package() once, here are some examples to pick from:

::

 Require GTK 2.6 or later
     find_package(GTK2 2.6 REQUIRED gtk)

::

 Require GTK 2.10 or later and Glade
     find_package(GTK2 2.10 REQUIRED gtk glade)

::

 Search for GTK/GTKMM 2.8 or later
     find_package(GTK2 2.8 COMPONENTS gtk gtkmm)

::

 if(GTK2_FOUND)
    include_directories(${GTK2_INCLUDE_DIRS})
    add_executable(mygui mygui.cc)
    target_link_libraries(mygui ${GTK2_LIBRARIES})
 endif()

FindGTK
-------

Find GTK, glib and GTKGLArea

::

 GTK_INCLUDE_DIR   - Directories to include to use GTK
 GTK_LIBRARIES     - Files to link against to use GTK
 GTK_FOUND         - GTK was found
 GTK_GL_FOUND      - GTK's GL features were found

FindHDF5
--------

Find Hierarchical Data Format (HDF5), a library for reading and writing
self describing array data.


This module invokes the ``HDF5`` wrapper compiler that should be installed
alongside ``HDF5``.  Depending upon the ``HDF5`` Configuration, the wrapper
compiler is called either ``h5cc`` or ``h5pcc``.  If this succeeds, the module
will then call the compiler with the show argument to see what flags
are used when compiling an ``HDF5`` client application.

The module will optionally accept the ``COMPONENTS`` argument.  If no
``COMPONENTS`` are specified, then the find module will default to finding
only the ``HDF5`` C library.  If one or more ``COMPONENTS`` are specified, the
module will attempt to find the language bindings for the specified
components.  The only valid components are ``C``, ``CXX``, ``Fortran``, ``HL``,
and ``Fortran_HL``.  If the ``COMPONENTS`` argument is not given, the module will
attempt to find only the C bindings.

This module will read the variable
``HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES`` to determine whether or not to prefer a
static link to a dynamic link for ``HDF5`` and all of it's dependencies.
To use this feature, make sure that the ``HDF5_USE_STATIC_LIBRARIES``
variable is set before the call to find_package.

To provide the module with a hint about where to find your ``HDF5``
installation, you can set the environment variable ``HDF5_ROOT``.  The
Find module will then look in this path when searching for ``HDF5``
executables, paths, and libraries.

Both the serial and parallel ``HDF5`` wrappers are considered and the first
directory to contain either one will be used.  In the event that both appear
in the same directory the serial version is preferentially selected. This
behavior can be reversed by setting the variable ``HDF5_PREFER_PARALLEL`` to
``True``.

In addition to finding the includes and libraries required to compile
an ``HDF5`` client application, this module also makes an effort to find
tools that come with the ``HDF5`` distribution that may be useful for
regression testing.

Note that ``<C>`` is the uppercased name of the component.

This module reads hints about search results from::

 Ice_HOME - the root of the Ice installation

The environment variable ``ICE_HOME`` may also be used; the
Ice_HOME variable takes precedence.

.. note::
  On Windows, Ice 3.7.0 and later provide libraries via the NuGet
  package manager.  Appropriate NuGet packages will be searched for
  using ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, or alternatively ``Ice_HOME`` may be
  set to the location of a specific NuGet package to restrict the
  search.

The following cache variables may also be set::

 Ice_<P>_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable <P>
 Ice_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice headers
 Ice_SLICE_DIR - the directory containing the Ice slice interface
                 definitions
 Ice_<C>_LIBRARY - the library for component <C>

.. note::

  In most cases none of the above variables will require setting,
  unless multiple Ice versions are available and a specific version
  is required.  On Windows, the most recent version of Ice will be
  found through the registry.  On Unix, the programs, headers and
  libraries will usually be in standard locations, but Ice_SLICE_DIRS
  might not be automatically detected (commonly known locations are
  searched).  All the other variables are defaulted using Ice_HOME,
  if set.  It's possible to set Ice_HOME and selectively specify
  alternative locations for the other components; this might be
  required for e.g. newer versions of Visual Studio if the
  heuristics are not sufficient to identify the correct programs and
  libraries for the specific Visual Studio version.

Other variables one may set to control this module are::

 Ice_DEBUG - Set to ON to enable debug output from FindIce.

``lx``, ``test``, ``tu`` and ``uc``.

Note that on Windows ``data`` is named ``dt`` and ``i18n`` is named
``in``; any of the names may be used, and the appropriate
platform-specific library name will be automatically selected.

This module reports information about the ICU installation in
several variables.  General variables::

 ICU_VERSION - ICU release version
 ICU_FOUND - true if the main programs and libraries were found
 ICU_LIBRARIES - component libraries to be linked

The environment variable ``ICU_ROOT`` may also be used; the
ICU_ROOT variable takes precedence.

The following cache variables may also be set::

 ICU_<P>_EXECUTABLE - the path to executable <P>
 ICU_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the ICU headers
 ICU_<C>_LIBRARY - the library for component <C>

.. note::

 find_package(ImageMagick COMPONENTS Magick++ convert)

Note that the standard ``find_package()`` features are supported (i.e.,
``QUIET``, ``REQUIRED``, etc.).

FindIconv
---------

This module finds the ``iconv()`` POSIX.1 functions on the system.
These functions might be provided in the regular C library or externally
in the form of an additional library.

The following variables are provided to indicate iconv support:

.. variable:: Iconv_FOUND

  Variable indicating if the iconv support was found.

.. variable:: Iconv_INCLUDE_DIRS

  The directories containing the iconv headers.

.. variable:: Iconv_LIBRARIES

  The iconv libraries to be linked.

.. variable:: Iconv_IS_BUILT_IN

  A variable indicating whether iconv support is stemming from the
  C library or not. Even if the C library provides `iconv()`, the presence of
  an external `libiconv` implementation might lead to this being false.

Additionally, the following ``IMPORTED`` target is being provided:

.. variable:: Iconv::Iconv

  Imported target for using iconv.

The following cache variables may also be set:

.. variable:: Iconv_INCLUDE_DIR

  The directory containing the iconv headers.

.. variable:: Iconv_LIBRARY

  The iconv library (if not implicitly given in the C library).

.. note::
  On POSIX platforms, iconv might be part of the C library and the cache
  variables ``Iconv_INCLUDE_DIR`` and ``Iconv_LIBRARY`` might be empty.


FindIntl
--------

Find the Gettext libintl headers and libraries.

This module reports information about the Gettext libintl
installation in several variables.  General variables::

 Intl_FOUND - true if the libintl headers and libraries were found
 Intl_INCLUDE_DIRS - the directory containing the libintl headers
 Intl_LIBRARIES - libintl libraries to be linked

The following cache variables may also be set::

 Intl_INCLUDE_DIR - the directory containing the libintl headers
 Intl_LIBRARY - the libintl library (if any)

.. note::
  On some platforms, such as Linux with GNU libc, the gettext
  functions are present in the C standard library and libintl
  is not required.  ``Intl_LIBRARIES`` will be empty in this
  case.

.. note::
  If you wish to use the Gettext tools (``msgmerge``,
  ``msgfmt``, etc.), use ``FindGettext``.

FindITK
-------

This module no longer exists.

This module existed in versions of CMake prior to 3.1, but became
only a thin wrapper around ``find_package(ITK NO_MODULE)`` to
provide compatibility for projects using long-outdated conventions.
Now ``find_package(ITK)`` will search for ``ITKConfig.cmake``
directly.

FindJasper
----------

Try to find the Jasper JPEG2000 library

Once done this will define

::

 JASPER_FOUND - system has Jasper
 JASPER_INCLUDE_DIR - the Jasper include directory

``find_package()`` syntax, e.g.

 find_package(Java 1.8)

NOTE: ``${Java_VERSION}`` and ``${Java_VERSION_STRING}`` are not guaranteed to
be identical.  For example some java version may return:
``Java_VERSION_STRING = 1.8.0_17`` and ``Java_VERSION = 1.8.0.17``

another example is the Java OEM, with: ``Java_VERSION_STRING = 1.8.0-oem``
and ``Java_VERSION = 1.8.0``

FindMatlab
----------

Finds Matlab or Matlab Compiler Runtime (MCR) and provides Matlab tools,
libraries and compilers to CMake.

This package primary purpose is to find the libraries associated with Matlab
or the MCR in order to be able to build Matlab extensions (mex files). It
can also be used:

* to run specific commands in Matlab in case Matlab is available
* for declaring Matlab unit test
* to retrieve various information from Matlab (mex extensions, versions and
  release queries, ...)

The module supports the following components:

* ``ENG_LIBRARY`` and ``MAT_LIBRARY``: respectively the ``ENG`` and ``MAT``
  libraries of Matlab
* ``MAIN_PROGRAM`` the Matlab binary program. Note that this component is not
  available on the MCR version, and will yield an error if the MCR is found
  instead of the regular Matlab installation.
* ``MEX_COMPILER`` the MEX compiler.
* ``MCC_COMPILER`` the MCC compiler, included with the Matlab Compiler add-on.
* ``SIMULINK`` the Simulink environment.

.. note::

  The version given to the ``find_package()`` directive is the Matlab
  **version**, which should not be confused with the Matlab *release* name
  (eg. `R2014`).
  The ``matlab_get_version_from_release_name()`` and
  ``matlab_get_release_name_from_version()`` provide a mapping
  between the release name and the version.

The variable ``Matlab_ROOT_DIR`` may be specified in order to give
the path of the desired Matlab version. Otherwise, the behaviour is platform
specific:

* Windows: The installed versions of Matlab/MCR are retrieved from the
  Windows registry
* OS X: The installed versions of Matlab/MCR are given by the MATLAB
  default installation paths in ``/Application``. If no such application is
  found, it falls back to the one that might be accessible from the ``PATH``.
* Unix: The desired Matlab should be accessible from the ``PATH``. This does
  not work for MCR installation and ``Matlab_ROOT_DIR`` should be
  specified on this platform.

Additional information is provided when ``MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG`` is set.
When a Matlab/MCR installation is found automatically and the ``MATLAB_VERSION``
is not given, the version is queried from Matlab directly (on Windows this
may pop up a Matlab window) or from the MCR installation.

The mapping of the release names and the version of Matlab is performed by
defining pairs (name, version).  The variable
``MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS`` may be provided before the call to
the ``find_package()`` in order to handle additional versions.

A Matlab scripts can be added to the set of tests using the
``matlab_add_unit_test()``. By default, the Matlab unit test framework
will be used (>= 2013a) to run this script, but regular ``.m`` files
returning an exit code can be used as well (0 indicating a success).

Provided macros
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``matlab_get_version_from_release_name()``
  returns the version from the release name
``matlab_get_release_name_from_version()``
  returns the release name from the Matlab version

Provided functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``matlab_add_unit_test()``
  adds a Matlab unit test file as a test to the project.
``matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry()``

Known issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Symbol clash in a MEX target**
  By default, every symbols inside a MEX
  file defined with the command ``matlab_add_mex()`` have hidden
  visibility, except for the entry point. This is the default behaviour of
  the MEX compiler, which lowers the risk of symbol collision between the
  libraries shipped with Matlab, and the libraries to which the MEX file is
  linking to. This is also the default on Windows platforms.

  However, this is not sufficient in certain case, where for instance your
  MEX file is linking against libraries that are already loaded by Matlab,
  even if those libraries have different SONAMES.
  A possible solution is to hide the symbols of the libraries to which the
  MEX target is linking to. This can be achieved in GNU GCC compilers with
  the linker option ``-Wl,--exclude-libs,ALL``.

**Tests using GPU resources**
  in case your MEX file is using the GPU and
  in order to be able to run unit tests on this MEX file, the GPU resources
  should be properly released by Matlab. A possible solution is to make
  Matlab aware of the use of the GPU resources in the session, which can be
  performed by a command such as ``D = gpuDevice()`` at the beginning of
  the test script (or via a fixture).


Reference
^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: Matlab_ROOT_DIR

   The root folder of the Matlab installation. If set before the call to
   ``find_package()``, the module will look for the components in that
   path. If not set, then an automatic search of Matlab
   will be performed. If set, it should point to a valid version of Matlab.

.. variable:: MATLAB_FIND_DEBUG

   If set, the lookup of Matlab and the intermediate configuration steps are
   outputted to the console.

.. variable:: MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS

  If set, specifies additional versions of Matlab that may be looked for.
  The variable should be a list of strings, organised by pairs of release
  name and versions, such as follows::

   set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
       "release_name1=corresponding_version1"
       "release_name2=corresponding_version2"
       ...
       )

 Example::

   set(MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS
       "R2013b=8.2"
       "R2013a=8.1"
       "R2012b=8.0")

 The order of entries in this list matters when several versions of
 Matlab are installed. The priority is set according to the ordering in
 this list.

.. command:: matlab_get_version_from_release_name

  Returns the version of Matlab (17.58) from a release name (R2017k)

.. command:: matlab_get_release_name_from_version

  Returns the release name (R2017k) from the version of Matlab (17.58)

.. command:: matlab_extract_all_installed_versions_from_registry

  This function parses the registry and founds the Matlab versions that are
  installed. The found versions are returned in `matlab_versions`.
  Set `win64` to `TRUE` if the 64 bit version of Matlab should be looked for
  The returned list contains all versions under
  ``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Mathworks\\MATLAB`` and
  ``HKLM\\SOFTWARE\\Mathworks\\MATLAB Runtime`` or an empty list in case an
  error occurred (or nothing found).

  .. note::

 Only the versions are provided. No check is made over the existence of the
 installation referenced in the registry,

.. command:: matlab_get_all_valid_matlab_roots_from_registry

  Populates the Matlab root with valid versions of Matlab or
  Matlab Runtime (MCR).
  The returned matlab_roots is organized in triplets
  ``(type,version_number,matlab_root_path)``, where ``type``
  indicates either ``MATLAB`` or ``MCR``.

 ``matlab_roots``
   the location of each of the Matlab or MCR installations

.. command:: matlab_get_mex_suffix

  Returns the extension of the mex files (the suffixes).

   matlab_get_version_from_matlab_run(
       matlab_binary_path
       matlab_list_versions)

 ``matlab_binary_path``
   the location of the `matlab` binary executable
 ``matlab_list_versions``
   the version extracted from Matlab

.. command:: matlab_add_unit_test

  Adds a Matlab unit test to the test set of cmake/ctest.
  This command requires the component ``MAIN_PROGRAM`` and hence is not
  available for an MCR installation.

  The unit test uses the Matlab unittest framework (default, available
  starting Matlab 2013b+) except if the option ``NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK``
  is given.

  The function expects one Matlab test script file to be given.
  In the case ``NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK`` is given, the unittest script file
  should contain the script to be run, plus an exit command with the exit
  value. This exit value will be passed to the ctest framework (0 success,
  non 0 failure). Additional arguments accepted by ``add_test()`` can be
  passed through ``TEST_ARGS`` (eg. ``CONFIGURATION <config> ...``).

   If this is not set, then the following is run:
   ``runtests('matlab_file_name'), exit(max([ans(1,:).Failed]))``
   where ``matlab_file_name`` is the ``UNITTEST_FILE`` without the extension.
 ``UNITTEST_PRECOMMAND``
   Matlab script command to be ran before the file
   containing the test (eg. GPU device initialisation based on CMake
   variables).
 ``TIMEOUT``
   the test timeout in seconds. Defaults to 180 seconds as the
   Matlab unit test may hang.
 ``ADDITIONAL_PATH``
   a list of paths to add to the Matlab path prior to
   running the unit test.
 ``MATLAB_ADDITIONAL_STARTUP_OPTIONS``
   a list of additional option in order
   to run Matlab from the command line.
   ``-nosplash -nodesktop -nodisplay`` are always added.
 ``TEST_ARGS``
   Additional options provided to the add_test command. These
   options are added to the default options (eg. "CONFIGURATIONS Release")
 ``NO_UNITTEST_FRAMEWORK``
   when set, indicates that the test should not
   use the unittest framework of Matlab (available for versions >= R2013a).
 ``WORKING_DIRECTORY``
   This will be the working directory for the test. If specified it will
   also be the output directory used for the log file of the test run.
   If not specified the temporary directory ``${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/Matlab`` will
   be used as the working directory and the log location.

.. command:: matlab_add_mex

  Adds a Matlab MEX target.
  This commands compiles the given sources with the current tool-chain in
  order to produce a MEX file. The final name of the produced output may be
  specified, as well as additional link libraries, and a documentation entry
  for the MEX file. Remaining arguments of the call are passed to the
  ``add_library()`` or ``add_executable()`` command.

  ::

    matlab_add_mex(
        NAME <name>
        [EXECUTABLE | MODULE | SHARED]
        SRC src1 [src2 ...]
        [OUTPUT_NAME output_name]
        [DOCUMENTATION file.txt]
        [LINK_TO target1 target2 ...]
        [R2017b | R2018a]
        [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL]
        [...]
    )

 ``NAME``
   name of the target.
 ``SRC``
   list of source files.
 ``LINK_TO``
   a list of additional link dependencies.  The target links to ``libmex``
   and ``libmx`` by default.
 ``OUTPUT_NAME``
   if given, overrides the default name. The default name is
   the name of the target without any prefix and
   with ``Matlab_MEX_EXTENSION`` suffix.
 ``DOCUMENTATION``
   if given, the file ``file.txt`` will be considered as
   being the documentation file for the MEX file. This file is copied into
   the same folder without any processing, with the same name as the final
   mex file, and with extension `.m`. In that case, typing ``help <name>``
   in Matlab prints the documentation contained in this file.
 ``R2017b`` or ``R2018a`` may be given to specify the version of the C API
   to use: ``R2017b`` specifies the traditional (separate complex) C API,
   and corresponds to the ``-R2017b`` flag for the `mex` command. ``R2018a``
   specifies the new interleaved complex C API, and corresponds to the
   ``-R2018a`` flag for the `mex` command. Ignored if MATLAB version prior
   to R2018a. Defaults to ``R2017b``.
 ``MODULE`` or ``SHARED`` may be given to specify the type of library to be
   created. ``EXECUTABLE`` may be given to create an executable instead of
   a library. If no type is given explicitly, the type is ``SHARED``.
 ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL``
   This option has the same meaning as for :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` and
   is forwarded to :command:`add_library` or :command:`add_executable`
   commands.

 MPEG_FOUND, If false, do not try to use MPEG.

also defined, but not for general use are

::

 MPEG_mpeg2_LIBRARY, where to find the MPEG library.
 MPEG_vo_LIBRARY, where to find the vo library.

FindMPI
-------

Find a Message Passing Interface (MPI) implementation.

The Message Passing Interface (MPI) is a library used to write
high-performance distributed-memory parallel applications, and is
typically deployed on a cluster.  MPI is a standard interface (defined
by the MPI forum) for which many implementations are available.

Variables for using MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The module exposes the components ``C``, ``CXX``, ``MPICXX`` and ``Fortran``.
Each of these controls the various MPI languages to search for.
The difference between ``CXX`` and ``MPICXX`` is that ``CXX`` refers to the
MPI C API being usable from C++, whereas ``MPICXX`` refers to the MPI-2 C++ API
that was removed again in MPI-3.

Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:

``MPI_FOUND``
  Variable indicating that MPI settings for all requested languages have been found.
  If no components are specified, this is true if MPI settings for all enabled languages
  were detected. Note that the ``MPICXX`` component does not affect this variable.
``MPI_VERSION``
  Minimal version of MPI detected among the requested languages, or all enabled languages
  if no components were specified.

This module will set the following variables per language in your
project, where ``<lang>`` is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``MPI_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating the MPI settings for ``<lang>`` were found and that
  simple MPI test programs compile with the provided settings.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER``
  MPI compiler for ``<lang>`` if such a program exists.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_OPTIONS``
  Compilation options for MPI programs in ``<lang>``, given as a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
  Compilation definitions for MPI programs in ``<lang>``, given as a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`.
``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Include path(s) for MPI header.
``MPI_<lang>_LINK_FLAGS``
  Linker flags for MPI programs.
``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
  All libraries to link MPI programs against.

Additionally, the following ``IMPORTED`` targets are defined:

``MPI::MPI_<lang>``
  Target for using MPI from ``<lang>``.

The following variables indicating which bindings are present will be defined:

``MPI_MPICXX_FOUND``
  Variable indicating whether the MPI-2 C++ bindings are present (introduced in MPI-2, removed with MPI-3).
``MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F77_HEADER``
  True if the Fortran 77 header ``mpif.h`` is available.
``MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F90_MODULE``
  True if the Fortran 90 module ``mpi`` can be used for accessing MPI (MPI-2 and higher only).
``MPI_Fortran_HAVE_F08_MODULE``
  True if the Fortran 2008 ``mpi_f08`` is available to MPI programs (MPI-3 and higher only).

If possible, the MPI version will be determined by this module. The facilities to detect the MPI version
were introduced with MPI-1.2, and therefore cannot be found for older MPI versions.

``MPI_<lang>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  Major version of MPI implemented for ``<lang>`` by the MPI distribution.
``MPI_<lang>_VERSION_MINOR``
  Minor version of MPI implemented for ``<lang>`` by the MPI distribution.
``MPI_<lang>_VERSION``
  MPI version implemented for ``<lang>`` by the MPI distribution.

Note that there's no variable for the C bindings being accessible through ``mpi.h``, since the MPI standards
always have required this binding to work in both C and C++ code.

For running MPI programs, the module sets the following variables

``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE``
  Executable for running MPI programs, if such exists.
``MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG``
  Flag to pass to ``mpiexec`` before giving it the number of processors to run on.
``MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS``
  Number of MPI processors to utilize. Defaults to the number
  of processors detected on the host system.
``MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS``
  Flags to pass to ``mpiexec`` directly before the executable to run.
``MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS``
  Flags to pass to ``mpiexec`` after other flags.

Variables for locating MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module performs a three step search for an MPI implementation:

1. Check if the compiler has MPI support built-in. This is the case if the user passed a
   compiler wrapper as ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`` or if they're on a Cray system.
2. Attempt to find an MPI compiler wrapper and determine the compiler information from it.
3. Try to find an MPI implementation that does not ship such a wrapper by guessing settings.
   Currently, only Microsoft MPI and MPICH2 on Windows are supported.

For controlling the second step, the following variables may be set:

``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER``
  Search for the specified compiler wrapper and use it.
``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER_FLAGS``
  Flags to pass to the MPI compiler wrapper during interrogation. Some compiler wrappers
  support linking debug or tracing libraries if a specific flag is passed and this variable
  may be used to obtain them.
``MPI_COMPILER_FLAGS``
  Used to initialize ``MPI_<lang>_COMPILER_FLAGS`` if no language specific flag has been given.
  Empty by default.
``MPI_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX``
  A suffix which is appended to all names that are being looked for. For instance you may set this
  to ``.mpich`` or ``.openmpi`` to prefer the one or the other on Debian and its derivatives.

In order to control the guessing step, the following variable may be set:

``MPI_GUESS_LIBRARY_NAME``
  Valid values are ``MSMPI`` and ``MPICH2``. If set, only the given library will be searched for.
  By default, ``MSMPI`` will be preferred over ``MPICH2`` if both are available.
  This also sets ``MPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER`` to ``true``, which may be overridden.

Each of the search steps may be skipped with the following control variables:

``MPI_ASSUME_NO_BUILTIN_MPI``
  If true, the module assumes that the compiler itself does not provide an MPI implementation and
  skips to step 2.
``MPI_SKIP_COMPILER_WRAPPER``
  If true, no compiler wrapper will be searched for.
``MPI_SKIP_GUESSING``
  If true, the guessing step will be skipped.

Additionally, the following control variable is available to change search behavior:

``MPI_CXX_SKIP_MPICXX``
  Add some definitions that will disable the MPI-2 C++ bindings.
  Currently supported are MPICH, Open MPI, Platform MPI and derivatives thereof,
  for example MVAPICH or Intel MPI.

If the find procedure fails for a variable ``MPI_<lang>_WORKS``, then the settings detected by or passed to
the module did not work and even a simple MPI test program failed to compile.

If all of these parameters were not sufficient to find the right MPI implementation, a user may
disable the entire autodetection process by specifying both a list of libraries in ``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
and a list of include directories in ``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS``.
Any other variable may be set in addition to these two. The module will then validate the MPI settings and store the
settings in the cache.

Cache variables for MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The variable ``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` will be assembled from the following variables.
For C and CXX:

``MPI_<lang>_HEADER_DIR``
  Location of the ``mpi.h`` header on disk.

For Fortran:

``MPI_Fortran_F77_HEADER_DIR``
  Location of the Fortran 77 header ``mpif.h``, if it exists.
``MPI_Fortran_MODULE_DIR``
  Location of the ``mpi`` or ``mpi_f08`` modules, if available.

For all languages the following variables are additionally considered:

``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of paths needed in addition to the normal include directories.
``MPI_<include_name>_INCLUDE_DIR``
  Path variables for include folders referred to by ``<include_name>``.
``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_VARS``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of ``<include_name>`` that will be added to the include locations of ``<lang>``.

The variable ``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARIES`` will be assembled from the following variables:

``MPI_<lib_name>_LIBRARY``
  The location of a library called ``<lib_name>`` for use with MPI.
``MPI_<lang>_LIB_NAMES``
  A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of ``<lib_name>`` that will be added to the include locations of ``<lang>``.

Usage of mpiexec
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When using ``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`` to execute MPI applications, you should typically
use all of the ``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`` flags as follows:

::

 ${MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE} ${MPIEXEC_NUMPROC_FLAG} ${MPIEXEC_MAX_NUMPROCS}
   ${MPIEXEC_PREFLAGS} EXECUTABLE ${MPIEXEC_POSTFLAGS} ARGS

where ``EXECUTABLE`` is the MPI program, and ``ARGS`` are the arguments to
pass to the MPI program.

Advanced variables for using MPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The module can perform some advanced feature detections upon explicit request.

**Important notice:** The following checks cannot be performed without *executing* an MPI test program.
Consider the special considerations for the behavior of ``try_run()`` during cross compilation.
Moreover, running an MPI program can cause additional issues, like a firewall notification on some systems.
You should only enable these detections if you absolutely need the information.

If the following variables are set to true, the respective search will be performed:

``MPI_DETERMINE_Fortran_CAPABILITIES``
  Determine for all available Fortran bindings what the values of ``MPI_SUBARRAYS_SUPPORTED`` and
  ``MPI_ASYNC_PROTECTS_NONBLOCKING`` are and make their values available as ``MPI_Fortran_<binding>_SUBARRAYS``
  and ``MPI_Fortran_<binding>_ASYNCPROT``, where ``<binding>`` is one of ``F77_HEADER``, ``F90_MODULE`` and
  ``F08_MODULE``.
``MPI_DETERMINE_LIBRARY_VERSION``
  For each language, find the output of ``MPI_Get_library_version`` and make it available as ``MPI_<lang>_LIBRARY_VERSION_STRING``.
  This information is usually tied to the runtime component of an MPI implementation and might differ depending on ``<lang>``.
  Note that the return value is entirely implementation defined. This information might be used to identify
  the MPI vendor and for example pick the correct one of multiple third party binaries that matches the MPI vendor.

Backward Compatibility
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For backward compatibility with older versions of FindMPI, these
variables are set, but deprecated:

::

 MPI_COMPILER        MPI_LIBRARY        MPI_EXTRA_LIBRARY
 MPI_COMPILE_FLAGS   MPI_INCLUDE_PATH   MPI_LINK_FLAGS
 MPI_LIBRARIES

In new projects, please use the ``MPI_<lang>_XXX`` equivalents.
Additionally, the following variables are deprecated:

``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_FLAGS``
  Use ``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` and ``MPI_<lang>_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` instead.
``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_PATH``
  For consumption use ``MPI_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` and for specifying folders use ``MPI_<lang>_ADDITIONAL_INCLUDE_DIRS`` instead.
``MPIEXEC``
  Use ``MPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE`` instead.

FindODBC
--------

Find an Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) include directory and library.

On Windows, when building with Visual Studio, this module assumes the ODBC
library is provided by the available Windows SDK.

On Unix, this module allows to search for ODBC library provided by
unixODBC or iODBC implementations of ODBC API.
This module reads hint about location of the config program:

.. variable:: ODBC_CONFIG

  Location of odbc_config or iodbc-config program

Otherwise, this module tries to find the config program,
first from unixODBC, then from iODBC.
If no config program found, this module searches for ODBC header
and library in list of known locations.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

.. variable:: ODBC::ODBC

  Imported target for using the ODBC library, if found.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: ODBC_FOUND

  Set to true if ODBC library found, otherwise false or undefined.

.. variable:: ODBC_INCLUDE_DIRS

  Paths to include directories listed in one variable for use by ODBC client.
  May be empty on Windows, where the include directory corresponding to the
  expected Windows SDK is already available in the compilation environment.

.. variable:: ODBC_LIBRARIES

  Paths to libraries to linked against to use ODBC.
  May just a library name on Windows, where the library directory corresponding
  to the expected Windows SDK is already available in the compilation environment.

.. variable:: ODBC_CONFIG

  Path to unixODBC or iODBC config program, if found or specified.

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For users who wish to edit and control the module behavior, this module
reads hints about search locations from the following variables:

.. variable:: ODBC_INCLUDE_DIR

  Path to ODBC include directory with ``sql.h`` header.

.. variable:: ODBC_LIBRARY

  Path to ODBC library to be linked.

These variables should not be used directly by project code.

Limitations
^^^^^^^^^^^

On Windows, this module does not search for iODBC.
On Unix, there is no way to prefer unixODBC over iODBC, or vice versa,
other than providing the config program location using the ``ODBC_CONFIG``.
This module does not allow to search for a specific ODBC driver.


FindOpenACC
-----------

Detect OpenACC support by the compiler.

This module can be used to detect OpenACC support in a compiler.
If the compiler supports OpenACC, the flags required to compile with
OpenACC support are returned in variables for the different languages.
Currently, only PGI, GNU and Cray compilers are supported.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables per language in your
project, where ``<lang>`` is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``OpenACC_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating if OpenACC support for ``<lang>`` was detected.
``OpenACC_<lang>_FLAGS``
  OpenACC compiler flags for ``<lang>``, separated by spaces.
``OpenACC_<lang>_OPTIONS``
  OpenACC compiler flags for ``<lang>``, as a list. Suitable for usage
  with target_compile_options or target_link_options.

Additionally, the module provides ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenACC::OpenACC_<lang>``
  Target for using OpenACC from ``<lang>``.

The module will also try to provide the OpenACC version variables:

``OpenACC_<lang>_SPEC_DATE``
  Date of the OpenACC specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenACC_<lang>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  Major version of OpenACC implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenACC_<lang>_VERSION_MINOR``
  Minor version of OpenACC implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenACC_<lang>_VERSION``
  OpenACC version implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

The specification date is formatted as given in the OpenACC standard:
``yyyymm`` where ``yyyy`` and ``mm`` represents the year and month of
the OpenACC specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

Input Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``OpenACC_ACCEL_TARGET=<target>``
If set, will the correct target accelerator flag set to the <target> will
be returned with OpenACC_<lang>_FLAGS.

FindOpenAL
----------


Finds Open Audio Library (OpenAL).
This module defines ``OPENAL_LIBRARY OPENAL_FOUND``, if
false, do not try to link to OpenAL ``OPENAL_INCLUDE_DIR``, where to find
the headers.

``$OPENALDIR`` is an environment variable that would correspond to the
``./configure --prefix=$OPENALDIR`` used in building OpenAL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the ``FindSDL.cmake``
module.

FindOpenCL
----------

Finds Open Computing Language (OpenCL)

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines ``IMPORTED`` target ``OpenCL::OpenCL``, if
OpenCL has been found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following variables::

 OpenCL_FOUND          - True if OpenCL was found
 OpenCL_INCLUDE_DIRS   - include directories for OpenCL
 OpenCL_LIBRARIES      - link against this library to use OpenCL
 OpenCL_VERSION_STRING - Highest supported OpenCL version (eg. 1.2)
 OpenCL_VERSION_MAJOR  - The major version of the OpenCL implementation
 OpenCL_VERSION_MINOR  - The minor version of the OpenCL implementation

The module will also define two cache variables::

 OpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR    - the OpenCL include directory
 OpenCL_LIBRARY        - the path to the OpenCL library

FindOpenGL
----------

FindModule for OpenGL and OpenGL Utility Library (GLU).

Optional COMPONENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module respects several optional COMPONENTS: ``EGL``, ``GLX``, and
``OpenGL``.  There are corresponding import targets for each of these flags.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenGL::GL``
 Defined to the platform-specific OpenGL libraries if the system has OpenGL.
``OpenGL::OpenGL``
 Defined to libOpenGL if the system is GLVND-based.
``OpenGL::GLU``
 Defined if the system has OpenGL Utility Library (GLU).
``OpenGL::GLX``
 Defined if the system has OpenGL Extension to the X Window System (GLX).
``OpenGL::EGL``
 Defined if the system has EGL.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module sets the following variables:

``OPENGL_FOUND``
 True, if the system has OpenGL and all components are found.
``OPENGL_XMESA_FOUND``
 True, if the system has XMESA.
``OPENGL_GLU_FOUND``
 True, if the system has GLU.
``OpenGL_OpenGL_FOUND``
 True, if the system has an OpenGL library.
``OpenGL_GLX_FOUND``
 True, if the system has GLX.
``OpenGL_EGL_FOUND``
 True, if the system has EGL.
``OPENGL_INCLUDE_DIR``
 Path to the OpenGL include directory.
``OPENGL_EGL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
 Path to the EGL include directory.
``OPENGL_LIBRARIES``
 Paths to the OpenGL library, windowing system libraries, and GLU libraries.
 On Linux, this assumes GLX and is never correct for EGL-based targets.
 Clients are encouraged to use the ``OpenGL::*`` import targets instead.

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``OPENGL_egl_LIBRARY``
 Path to the EGL library.
``OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY``
 Path to the GLU library.
``OPENGL_glx_LIBRARY``
 Path to the GLVND 'GLX' library.
``OPENGL_opengl_LIBRARY``
 Path to the GLVND 'OpenGL' library
``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY``
 Path to the OpenGL library.  New code should prefer the ``OpenGL::*`` import
 targets.

Linux-specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some Linux systems utilize GLVND as a new ABI for OpenGL.  GLVND separates
context libraries from OpenGL itself; OpenGL lives in "libOpenGL", and
contexts are defined in "libGLX" or "libEGL".  GLVND is currently the only way
to get OpenGL 3+ functionality via EGL in a manner portable across vendors.
Projects may use GLVND explicitly with target ``OpenGL::OpenGL`` and either
``OpenGL::GLX`` or ``OpenGL::EGL``.

Projects may use the ``OpenGL::GL`` target (or ``OPENGL_LIBRARIES`` variable)
to use legacy GL interfaces.  These will use the legacy GL library located
by ``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY``, if available.  If ``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY`` is empty or
not found and GLVND is available, the ``OpenGL::GL`` target will use GLVND
``OpenGL::OpenGL`` and ``OpenGL::GLX`` (and the ``OPENGL_LIBRARIES``
variable will use the corresponding libraries).  Thus, for non-EGL-based
Linux targets, the ``OpenGL::GL`` target is most portable.

A ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` variable may be set to specify the preferred way
to provide legacy GL interfaces in case multiple choices are available.
The value may be one of:

``GLVND``
 If the GLVND OpenGL and GLX libraries are available, prefer them.
 This forces ``OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY`` to be empty.
 This is the default if components were requested (since components
 correspond to GLVND libraries) or if policy ``CMP0072`` is
 set to ``NEW``.

``LEGACY``
 Prefer to use the legacy libGL library, if available.
 This is the default if no components were requested and
 policy ``CMP0072`` is not set to ``NEW``.

For EGL targets the client must rely on GLVND support on the user's system.
Linking should use the ``OpenGL::OpenGL OpenGL::EGL`` targets.  Using GLES*
libraries is theoretically possible in place of ``OpenGL::OpenGL``, but this
module does not currently support that; contributions welcome.

``OPENGL_egl_LIBRARY`` and ``OPENGL_EGL_INCLUDE_DIRS`` are defined in the case of
GLVND.  For non-GLVND Linux and other systems these are left undefined.

macOS-Specific
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On OSX FindOpenGL defaults to using the framework version of OpenGL. People
will have to change the cache values of OPENGL_glu_LIBRARY and
OPENGL_gl_LIBRARY to use OpenGL with X11 on OSX.

FindOpenMP
----------

Finds Open Multi-Processing (OpenMP) support.

This module can be used to detect OpenMP support in a compiler.  If
the compiler supports OpenMP, the flags required to compile with
OpenMP support are returned in variables for the different languages.
The variables may be empty if the compiler does not need a special
flag to support OpenMP.

Variables
^^^^^^^^^

The module exposes the components ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``Fortran``.
Each of these controls the various languages to search OpenMP support for.

Depending on the enabled components the following variables will be set:

``OpenMP_FOUND``
  Variable indicating that OpenMP flags for all requested languages have been found.
  If no components are specified, this is true if OpenMP settings for all enabled languages
  were detected.
``OpenMP_VERSION``
  Minimal version of the OpenMP standard detected among the requested languages,
  or all enabled languages if no components were specified.

This module will set the following variables per language in your
project, where ``<lang>`` is one of C, CXX, or Fortran:

``OpenMP_<lang>_FOUND``
  Variable indicating if OpenMP support for ``<lang>`` was detected.
``OpenMP_<lang>_FLAGS``
  OpenMP compiler flags for ``<lang>``, separated by spaces.
``OpenMP_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  Directories that must be added to the header search path for ``<lang>``
  when using OpenMP.

For linking with OpenMP code written in ``<lang>``, the following
variables are provided:

``OpenMP_<lang>_LIB_NAMES``
  :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of libraries for OpenMP programs for ``<lang>``.
``OpenMP_<libname>_LIBRARY``
  Location of the individual libraries needed for OpenMP support in ``<lang>``.
``OpenMP_<lang>_LIBRARIES``
  A list of libraries needed to link with OpenMP code written in ``<lang>``.

Additionally, the module provides ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenMP::OpenMP_<lang>``
  Target for using OpenMP from ``<lang>``.

Specifically for Fortran, the module sets the following variables:

``OpenMP_Fortran_HAVE_OMPLIB_HEADER``
  Boolean indicating if OpenMP is accessible through ``omp_lib.h``.
``OpenMP_Fortran_HAVE_OMPLIB_MODULE``
  Boolean indicating if OpenMP is accessible through the ``omp_lib`` Fortran module.

The module will also try to provide the OpenMP version variables:

``OpenMP_<lang>_SPEC_DATE``
  Date of the OpenMP specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenMP_<lang>_VERSION_MAJOR``
  Major version of OpenMP implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenMP_<lang>_VERSION_MINOR``
  Minor version of OpenMP implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.
``OpenMP_<lang>_VERSION``
  OpenMP version implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

The specification date is formatted as given in the OpenMP standard:
``yyyymm`` where ``yyyy`` and ``mm`` represents the year and month of
the OpenMP specification implemented by the ``<lang>`` compiler.

For some compilers, it may be necessary to add a header search path to find
the relevant OpenMP headers.  This location may be language-specific.  Where
this is needed, the module may attempt to find the location, but it can be
provided directly by setting the ``OpenMP_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIR`` cache variable.
Note that this variable is an _input_ control to the module.  Project code
should use the ``OpenMP_<lang>_INCLUDE_DIRS`` _output_ variable if it needs
to know what include directories are needed.

FindOpenSceneGraph
------------------

Find OpenSceneGraph (3D graphics application programming interface)

This module searches for the OpenSceneGraph core "osg" library as well
as ``FindOpenThreads``, and whatever additional ``COMPONENTS``
(nodekits) that you specify.

::

 See http://www.openscenegraph.org

NOTE: To use this module effectively you must either require ``CMake >=
2.6.3`` with  ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 2.6.3)`` or download
and place ``FindOpenThreads``, ``Findosg`` functions,
``Findosg`` and ``Find<etc>.cmake`` files into your
``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``.

==================================

This module accepts the following variables (note mixed case)

::

 OpenSceneGraph_DEBUG - Enable debugging output

::

 OpenSceneGraph_MARK_AS_ADVANCED - Mark cache variables as advanced
                                   automatically

The following environment variables are also respected for finding the
OSG and it's various components.  ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` can also be
used for this (see ``find_library()`` CMake documentation).

``<MODULE>_DIR``
  (where ``MODULE`` is of the form "OSGVOLUME" and there is
  a ``FindosgVolume``.cmake` file)
``OSG_DIR``
  ..
``OSGDIR``
  ..
``OSG_ROOT``
  ..


[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variable ``OSG_DIR`` can now be used as well to
influence detection, instead of needing to specify an environment
variable.

This module defines the following output variables:

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_FOUND - Was the OSG and all of the specified components found?

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_VERSION - The version of the OSG which was found

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS - Where to find the headers

::

 OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES - The OSG libraries

================================== Example Usage:

::

 find_package(OpenSceneGraph 2.0.0 REQUIRED osgDB osgUtil)
     # libOpenThreads & libosg automatically searched
 include_directories(${OPENSCENEGRAPH_INCLUDE_DIRS})

::

 add_executable(foo foo.cc)
 target_link_libraries(foo ${OPENSCENEGRAPH_LIBRARIES})

FindOpenSSL
-----------

Find the OpenSSL encryption library.

Optional COMPONENTS
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module supports two optional COMPONENTS: ``Crypto`` and ``SSL``.  Both
components have associated imported targets, as described below.

Imported Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``OpenSSL::SSL``
  The OpenSSL ``ssl`` library, if found.
``OpenSSL::Crypto``
  The OpenSSL ``crypto`` library, if found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``OPENSSL_FOUND``
  System has the OpenSSL library. If no components are requested it only
  requires the crypto library.
``OPENSSL_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The OpenSSL include directory.
``OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARY``
  The OpenSSL crypto library.
``OPENSSL_CRYPTO_LIBRARIES``
  The OpenSSL crypto library and its dependencies.
``OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARY``
  The OpenSSL SSL library.
``OPENSSL_SSL_LIBRARIES``
  The OpenSSL SSL library and its dependencies.
``OPENSSL_LIBRARIES``
  All OpenSSL libraries and their dependencies.
``OPENSSL_VERSION``
  This is set to ``$major.$minor.$revision$patch`` (e.g. ``0.9.8s``).

Hints
^^^^^

Set ``OPENSSL_ROOT_DIR`` to the root directory of an OpenSSL installation.
Set ``OPENSSL_USE_STATIC_LIBS`` to ``TRUE`` to look for static libraries.
Set ``OPENSSL_MSVC_STATIC_RT`` set ``TRUE`` to choose the MT version of the lib.

FindOpenThreads
---------------



OpenThreads is a C++ based threading library.  Its largest userbase
seems to OpenSceneGraph so you might notice I accept OSGDIR as an
environment path.  I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to
find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you
must opt in to each module.

Locate OpenThreads This module defines OPENTHREADS_LIBRARY
OPENTHREADS_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to OpenThreads
OPENTHREADS_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find the headers

$OPENTHREADS_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to
the ./configure --prefix=$OPENTHREADS_DIR used in building osg.

[CMake 2.8.10]: The CMake variables OPENTHREADS_DIR or OSG_DIR can now
be used as well to influence detection, instead of needing to specify
an environment variable.

Created by Eric Wing.

FindosgAnimation
----------------



This is part of the Findosg* suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
module (perhaps because the default FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't
work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more
convenient module that includes everything, use the
FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake modules.

Locate osgAnimation This module defines

OSGANIMATION_FOUND - Was osgAnimation found? OSGANIMATION_INCLUDE_DIR
- Where to find the headers OSGANIMATION_LIBRARIES - The libraries to
link against for the OSG (use this)

OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY - The OSG library OSGANIMATION_LIBRARY_DEBUG -
The OSG debug library

$OSGDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.

Created by Eric Wing.

FindosgDB

This is part of the ``Findosg*`` suite used to find OpenSceneGraph
components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each
module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer
if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you
control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt
out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular
module (perhaps because the default ``FindOpenGL`` module doesn't
work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more
convenient module that includes everything, use the
``FindOpenSceneGraph`` instead of the ``Findosg*.cmake`` modules.

Locate osgDB This module defines:

``OSGDB_FOUND``

``OSGDB_LIBRARY``
  The osgDB library

``OSGDB_LIBRARY_DEBUG``
  The osgDB debug library

``$OSGDIR`` is an environment variable that would correspond to::

 ./configure --prefix=$OSGDIR used in building osg.

FindPkgConfig
-------------

A ``pkg-config`` module for CMake.

Finds the ``pkg-config`` executable and adds the ``pkg_get_variable()``,
``pkg_check_modules()`` and ``pkg_search_module()`` commands. The
following variables will also be set:

``PKG_CONFIG_FOUND``
  if pkg-config executable was found
``PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE``
  pathname of the pkg-config program
``PKG_CONFIG_VERSION_STRING``
  version of pkg-config (since CMake 2.8.8)


.. command:: pkg_check_modules

  Checks for all the given modules, setting a variety of result variables in
  the calling scope.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules(<prefix>
                      [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [IMPORTED_TARGET [GLOBAL]]
                      <moduleSpec> [<moduleSpec>...])

  When the ``REQUIRED`` argument is given, the command will fail with an error
  if module(s) could not be found.

  When the ``QUIET`` argument is given, no status messages will be printed.

  By default, if ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION`` is 3.1 or
  later, or if ``PKG_CONFIG_USE_CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` is set to a
  boolean ``True`` value, then the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``,
  ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH``, and ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH`` cache
  and environment variables will be added to the ``pkg-config`` search path.
  The ``NO_CMAKE_PATH`` and ``NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH`` arguments
  disable this behavior for the cache variables and environment variables
  respectively.

  The ``IMPORTED_TARGET`` argument will create an imported target named
  ``PkgConfig::<prefix>`` that can be passed directly as an argument to
  ``target_link_libraries()``. The ``GLOBAL`` argument will make the
  imported target available in global scope.

  Each ``<moduleSpec>`` can be either a bare module name or it can be a
  module name with a version constraint (operators ``=``, ``<``, ``>``,
  ``<=`` and ``>=`` are supported).  The following are examples for a module
  named ``foo`` with various constraints:

  - ``foo`` matches any version.
  - ``foo<2`` only matches versions before 2.
  - ``foo>=3.1`` matches any version from 3.1 or later.
  - ``foo=1.2.3`` requires that foo must be exactly version 1.2.3.

  The following variables may be set upon return.  Two sets of values exist:
  One for the common case (``<XXX> = <prefix>``) and another for the
  information ``pkg-config`` provides when called with the ``--static``
  option (``<XXX> = <prefix>_STATIC``).

  ``<XXX>_FOUND``
    set to 1 if module(s) exist
  ``<XXX>_LIBRARIES``
    only the libraries (without the '-l')
  ``<XXX>_LINK_LIBRARIES``
    the libraries and their absolute paths
  ``<XXX>_LIBRARY_DIRS``
    the paths of the libraries (without the '-L')
  ``<XXX>_LDFLAGS``
    all required linker flags
  ``<XXX>_LDFLAGS_OTHER``
    all other linker flags
  ``<XXX>_INCLUDE_DIRS``
    the '-I' preprocessor flags (without the '-I')
  ``<XXX>_CFLAGS``
    all required cflags
  ``<XXX>_CFLAGS_OTHER``
    the other compiler flags

  All but ``<XXX>_FOUND`` may be a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` if the
  associated variable returned from ``pkg-config`` has multiple values.

  There are some special variables whose prefix depends on the number of
  ``<moduleSpec>`` given.  When there is only one ``<moduleSpec>``,
  ``<YYY>`` will simply be ``<prefix>``, but if two or more ``<moduleSpec>``
  items are given, ``<YYY>`` will be ``<prefix>_<moduleName>``.

  ``<YYY>_VERSION``
    version of the module
  ``<YYY>_PREFIX``
    prefix directory of the module
  ``<YYY>_INCLUDEDIR``
    include directory of the module
  ``<YYY>_LIBDIR``
    lib directory of the module

  Examples:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0)

  Looks for any version of glib2.  If found, the output variable
  ``GLIB2_VERSION`` will hold the actual version found.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (GLIB2 glib-2.0>=2.10)

  Looks for at least version 2.10 of glib2.  If found, the output variable
  ``GLIB2_VERSION`` will hold the actual version found.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (FOO glib-2.0>=2.10 gtk+-2.0)

  Looks for both glib2-2.0 (at least version 2.10) and any version of
  gtk2+-2.0.  Only if both are found will ``FOO`` be considered found.
  The ``FOO_glib-2.0_VERSION`` and ``FOO_gtk+-2.0_VERSION`` variables will be
  set to their respective found module versions.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_check_modules (XRENDER REQUIRED xrender)

  Requires any version of ``xrender``.  Example output variables set by a
  successful call::

 XRENDER_LIBRARIES=Xrender;X11

.. command:: pkg_search_module

  The behavior of this command is the same as ``pkg_check_modules()``,
  except that rather than checking for all the specified modules, it searches
  for just the first successful match.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_search_module(<prefix>
                      [REQUIRED] [QUIET]
                      [NO_CMAKE_PATH]
                      [NO_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH]
                      [IMPORTED_TARGET [GLOBAL]]
                      <moduleSpec> [<moduleSpec>...])

  If a module is found, the ``<prefix>_MODULE_NAME`` variable will contain the
  name of the matching module. This variable can be used if you need to run
  ``pkg_get_variable()``.

  Example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_search_module (BAR libxml-2.0 libxml2 libxml>=2)

.. command:: pkg_get_variable

  Retrieves the value of a pkg-config variable ``varName`` and stores it in the
  result variable ``resultVar`` in the calling scope.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_get_variable(<resultVar> <moduleName> <varName>)

  If ``pkg-config`` returns multiple values for the specified variable,
  ``resultVar`` will contain a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>`.

  For example:

  .. code-block:: cmake

    pkg_get_variable(GI_GIRDIR gobject-introspection-1.0 girdir)

Variables Affecting Behavior
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: PKG_CONFIG_EXECUTABLE

  This can be set to the path of the pkg-config executable.  If not provided,
  it will be set by the module as a result of calling ``find_program()``
  internally.  The ``PKG_CONFIG`` environment variable can be used as a hint.

.. variable:: PKG_CONFIG_USE_CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH

  Specifies whether ``pkg_check_modules()`` and
  ``pkg_search_module()`` should add the paths in the
  ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH`` and
  ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH`` cache and environment variables to the
  ``pkg-config`` search path.

  If this variable is not set, this behavior is enabled by default if
  ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION`` is 3.1 or later, disabled
  otherwise.

FindPNG
-------

Find libpng, the official reference library for the PNG image format.

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` target:

``PNG::PNG``
  The libpng library, if found.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find png.h, etc.
``PNG_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use PNG.
``PNG_DEFINITIONS``
  You should add_definitions(${PNG_DEFINITIONS}) before compiling code
  that includes png library files.
``PNG_FOUND``
  If false, do not try to use PNG.
``PNG_VERSION_STRING``
  the version of the PNG library found (since CMake 2.8.8)

Obsolete variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables may also be set, for backwards compatibility:

``PNG_LIBRARY``
  where to find the PNG library.
``PNG_INCLUDE_DIR``
  where to find the PNG headers (same as PNG_INCLUDE_DIRS)

Since PNG depends on the ZLib compression library, none of the above
will be defined unless ZLib can be found.

FindPostgreSQL
--------------

Find the PostgreSQL installation.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines ``IMPORTED`` target ``PostgreSQL::PostgreSQL``
if PostgreSQL has been found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables in your project:

``PostgreSQL_FOUND``
  True if PostgreSQL is found.
``PostgreSQL_LIBRARIES``
  the PostgreSQL libraries needed for linking
``PostgreSQL_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  the directories of the PostgreSQL headers
``PostgreSQL_LIBRARY_DIRS``
  the link directories for PostgreSQL libraries
``PostgreSQL_VERSION_STRING``
  the version of PostgreSQL found

FindProducer
------------



Though Producer isn't directly part of OpenSceneGraph, its primary
user is OSG so I consider this part of the Findosg* suite used to find
OpenSceneGraph components.  You'll notice that I accept OSGDIR as an
environment path.

Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You
must also opt into OpenGL (and OpenThreads?) as these modules won't do
it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece
by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change
the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default
FindOpenGL.cmake module doesn't work with your system as an example).
If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything,
use the FindOpenSceneGraph.cmake instead of the Findosg*.cmake
modules.

Locate Producer This module defines PRODUCER_LIBRARY PRODUCER_FOUND,
if false, do not try to link to Producer PRODUCER_INCLUDE_DIR, where
to find the headers

$PRODUCER_DIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$PRODUCER_DIR used in building osg.

Created by Eric Wing.

* ``Compiler``: search for Python compiler. Only offered by IronPython.
* ``Development``: search for development artifacts (include directories and
  libraries).
* ``NumPy``: search for NumPy include directories.

If no ``COMPONENTS`` are specified, ``Interpreter`` is assumed.

To ensure consistent versions between components ``Interpreter``, ``Compiler``,

 find_package (Python COMPONENTS Interpreter Development)

This module looks preferably for version 3 of Python. If not found, version 2
is searched.
To manage concurrent versions 3 and 2 of Python, use ``FindPython3`` and
``FindPython2`` modules rather than this one.

.. note::

  If components ``Interpreter`` and ``Development`` are both specified, this
  module search only for interpreter with same platform architecture as the one
  defined by ``CMake`` configuration. This contraint does not apply if only
  ``Interpreter`` component is specified.

Hints
^^^^^

``Python_ROOT_DIR``
  Define the root directory of a Python installation.

``Python_USE_STATIC_LIBS``
  * If not defined, search for shared libraries and static libraries in that
    order.
  * If set to TRUE, search **only** for static libraries.
  * If set to FALSE, search **only** for shared libraries.

``Python_FIND_ABI``
  This variable defines which ABIs, as defined in
  PEP 3149, should be searched.

  .. note::

   This hint will be honored only when searched for ``Python`` version 3.

 .. note::

   If ``Python_FIND_ABI`` is not defined, any ABI will be searched.

 The ``Python_FIND_ABI`` variable is a 3-tuple specifying, in that order,
 ``pydebug`` (``d``), ``pymalloc`` (``m``) and ``unicode`` (``u``) flags.
 Each element can be set to one of the following:

 * ``ON``: Corresponding flag is selected.
 * ``OFF``: Corresponding flag is not selected.
 * ``ANY``: The two posibilties (``ON`` and ``OFF``) will be searched.

 From this 3-tuple, various ABIs will be searched starting from the most
 specialized to the most general. Moreover, ``debug`` versions will be
 searched **after** ``non-debug`` ones.

 For example, if we have::

   set (Python_FIND_ABI "ON" "ANY" "ANY")

 The following flags combinations will be appended, in that order, to the
 artifact names: ``dmu``, ``dm``, ``du``, and ``d``.

 And to search any possible ABIs::

   set (Python_FIND_ABI "ANY" "ANY" "ANY")

 The following combinations, in that order, will be used: ``mu``, ``m``,
 ``u``, ``<empty>``, ``dmu``, ``dm``, ``du`` and ``d``.

 .. note::

   This hint is useful only on ``POSIX`` systems. So, on ``Windows`` systems,
   when ``Python_FIND_ABI`` is defined, ``Python`` distributions from
   `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_ will be found only if value for
   each flag is ``OFF`` or ``ANY``.

``Python_FIND_STRATEGY``
  This variable defines how lookup will be done.
  The ``Python_FIND_STRATEGY`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``VERSION``: Try to find the most recent version in all specified
    locations.
    This is the default if policy ``CMP0094`` is undefined or set to
    ``OLD``.
  * ``LOCATION``: Stops lookup as soon as a version satisfying version
    constraints is founded.
    This is the default if policy ``CMP0094`` is set to ``NEW``.

``Python_FIND_REGISTRY``
  On Windows the ``Python_FIND_REGISTRY`` variable determine the order
  of preference between registry and environment variables.
  the ``Python_FIND_REGISTRY`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``FIRST``: Try to use registry before environment variables.
    This is the default.
  * ``LAST``: Try to use registry after environment variables.
  * ``NEVER``: Never try to use registry.

``Python_FIND_FRAMEWORK``
  On macOS the ``Python_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable determine the order of
  preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.
  This variable can be set to empty or take same values as
  ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable.

  .. note::

   Value ``ONLY`` is not supported so ``FIRST`` will be used instead.

 If ``Python_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` is not defined, :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`
 variable will be used, if any.

``Python_FIND_VIRTUALENV``
  This variable defines the handling of virtual environments. It is meaningfull
  only when a virtual environment is active (i.e. the ``activate`` script has
  been evaluated). In this case, it takes precedence over
  ``Python_FIND_REGISTRY`` and ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variables.
  The ``Python_FIND_VIRTUALENV`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``FIRST``: The virtual environment is used before any other standard
    paths to look-up for the interpreter. This is the default.
  * ``ONLY``: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the
    interpreter.
  * ``STANDARD``: The virtual environment is not used to look-up for the
    interpreter. In this case, variable ``Python_FIND_REGISTRY`` (Windows)
    or ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` (macOS) can be set with value ``LAST`` or
    ``NEVER`` to select preferably the interpreter from the virtual
    environment.

  .. note::

 If the component ``Development`` is requested, it is **strongly**
 recommended to also include the component ``Interpreter`` to get expected
 result.

Artifacts Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To solve special cases, it is possible to specify directly the artifacts by
setting the following variables:

``Python_EXECUTABLE``
  The path to the interpreter.

``Python_COMPILER``
  The path to the compiler.

``Python_LIBRARY``
  The path to the library. It will be used to compute the
  variables ``Python_LIBRARIES``, ``Python_LIBRAY_DIRS`` and
  ``Python_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS``.

``Python_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The path to the directory of the ``Python`` headers. It will be used to
  compute the variable ``Python_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

``Python_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The path to the directory of the ``NumPy`` headers. It will be used to
  compute the variable ``Python_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

.. note::

  All paths must be absolute. Any artifact specified with a relative path
  will be ignored.

.. note::

  When an artifact is specified, all ``HINTS`` will be ignored and no search
  will be performed for this artifact.

  If more than one artifact is specified, it is the user's responsability to
  ensure the consistency of the various artifacts.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

This module defines the command ``Python_add_library`` (when
``CMAKE_ROLE`` is ``PROJECT``), which has the same semantics as
``add_library()`` and adds a dependency to target ``Python::Python`` or,
when library type is ``MODULE``, to target ``Python::Module`` and takes care of
Python module naming rules::

 Python_add_library (my_module MODULE src1.cpp)

If library type is not specified, ``MODULE`` is assumed.

concurrently with ``FindPython3`` module to use both Python versions.

The ``FindPython`` module can be used if Python version does not matter
for you.

Hints
^^^^^

``Python3_ROOT_DIR``
  Define the root directory of a Python 3 installation.

``Python3_USE_STATIC_LIBS``
  * If not defined, search for shared libraries and static libraries in that
    order.
  * If set to TRUE, search **only** for static libraries.
  * If set to FALSE, search **only** for shared libraries.

``Python3_FIND_ABI``
  This variable defines which ABIs, as defined in
  PEP 3149, should be searched.

  .. note::

   If ``Python3_FIND_ABI`` is not defined, any ABI will be searched.

 The ``Python3_FIND_ABI`` variable is a 3-tuple specifying, in that order,
 ``pydebug`` (``d``), ``pymalloc`` (``m``) and ``unicode`` (``u``) flags.
 Each element can be set to one of the following:

 * ``ON``: Corresponding flag is selected.
 * ``OFF``: Corresponding flag is not selected.
 * ``ANY``: The two posibilties (``ON`` and ``OFF``) will be searched.

 From this 3-tuple, various ABIs will be searched starting from the most
 specialized to the most general. Moreover, ``debug`` versions will be
 searched **after** ``non-debug`` ones.

 For example, if we have::

   set (Python3_FIND_ABI "ON" "ANY" "ANY")

 The following flags combinations will be appended, in that order, to the
 artifact names: ``dmu``, ``dm``, ``du``, and ``d``.

 And to search any possible ABIs::

   set (Python3_FIND_ABI "ANY" "ANY" "ANY")

 The following combinations, in that order, will be used: ``mu``, ``m``,
 ``u``, ``<empty>``, ``dmu``, ``dm``, ``du`` and ``d``.

 .. note::

   This hint is useful only on ``POSIX`` systems. So, on ``Windows`` systems,
   when ``Python3_FIND_ABI`` is defined, ``Python`` distributions from
   `python.org <https://www.python.org/>`_ will be found only if value for
   each flag is ``OFF`` or ``ANY``.

``Python3_FIND_STRATEGY``
  This variable defines how lookup will be done.
  The ``Python3_FIND_STRATEGY`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``VERSION``: Try to find the most recent version in all specified
    locations.
    This is the default if policy ``CMP0094`` is undefined or set to
    ``OLD``.
  * ``LOCATION``: Stops lookup as soon as a version satisfying version
    constraints is founded.
    This is the default if policy ``CMP0094`` is set to ``NEW``.

``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY``
  On Windows the ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` variable determine the order
  of preference between registry and environment variables.
  The ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``FIRST``: Try to use registry before environment variables.
    This is the default.
  * ``LAST``: Try to use registry after environment variables.
  * ``NEVER``: Never try to use registry.

``Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK``
  On macOS the ``Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable determine the order of
  preference between Apple-style and unix-style package components.
  This variable can be set to empty or take same values as
  ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable.

  .. note::

   Value ``ONLY`` is not supported so ``FIRST`` will be used instead.

 If ``Python3_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` is not defined, :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`
 variable will be used, if any.

``Python3_FIND_VIRTUALENV``
  This variable defines the handling of virtual environments. It is meaningfull
  only when a virtual environment is active (i.e. the ``activate`` script has
  been evaluated). In this case, it takes precedence over
  ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` and ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variables.
  The ``Python3_FIND_VIRTUALENV`` variable can be set to empty or one of the
  following:

  * ``FIRST``: The virtual environment is used before any other standard
    paths to look-up for the interpreter. This is the default.
  * ``ONLY``: Only the virtual environment is used to look-up for the
    interpreter.
  * ``STANDARD``: The virtual environment is not used to look-up for the
    interpreter. In this case, variable ``Python3_FIND_REGISTRY`` (Windows)
    or ``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` (macOS) can be set with value ``LAST`` or
    ``NEVER`` to select preferably the interpreter from the virtual
    environment.

  .. note::

 If the component ``Development`` is requested, it is **strongly**
 recommended to also include the component ``Interpreter`` to get expected
 result.

Artifacts Specification
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To solve special cases, it is possible to specify directly the artifacts by
setting the following variables:

``Python3_EXECUTABLE``
  The path to the interpreter.

``Python3_COMPILER``
  The path to the compiler.

``Python3_LIBRARY``
  The path to the library. It will be used to compute the
  variables ``Python3_LIBRARIES``, ``Python3_LIBRAY_DIRS`` and
  ``Python3_RUNTIME_LIBRARY_DIRS``.

``Python3_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The path to the directory of the ``Python`` headers. It will be used to
  compute the variable ``Python3_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

``Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIR``
  The path to the directory of the ``NumPy`` headers. It will be used to
  compute the variable ``Python3_NumPy_INCLUDE_DIRS``.

.. note::

  All paths must be absolute. Any artifact specified with a relative path
  will be ignored.

.. note::

  When an artifact is specified, all ``HINTS`` will be ignored and no search
  will be performed for this artifact.

  If more than one artifact is specified, it is the user's responsability to
  ensure the consistency of the various artifacts.

Commands
^^^^^^^^

This module defines the command ``Python_add_library`` (when
``CMAKE_ROLE`` is ``PROJECT``), which has the same semantics as
``add_library()`` and adds a dependency to target ``Python3::Python`` or,
when library type is ``MODULE``, to target ``Python3::Module`` and takes care
of Python module naming rules::

 Python3_add_library (my_module MODULE src1.cpp)

If library type is not specified, ``MODULE`` is assumed.

FindQt3
-------

Locate Qt include paths and libraries

This module defines:

::

 QT_INCLUDE_DIR    - where to find qt.h, etc.
 QT_LIBRARIES      - the libraries to link against to use Qt.
 QT_DEFINITIONS    - definitions to use when
                     compiling code that uses Qt.
 QT_FOUND          - If false, don't try to use Qt.
 QT_VERSION_STRING - the version of Qt found

If you need the multithreaded version of Qt, set QT_MT_REQUIRED to
TRUE

Also defined, but not for general use are:

::

 QT_MOC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the moc tool.
 QT_UIC_EXECUTABLE, where to find the uic tool.
 QT_QT_LIBRARY, where to find the Qt library.
 QT_QTMAIN_LIBRARY, where to find the qtmain
  library. This is only required by Qt3 on Windows.

FindQt4
-------

Finding and Using Qt4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module can be used to find Qt4.  The most important issue is that
the Qt4 qmake is available via the system path.  This qmake is then
used to detect basically everything else.  This module defines a
number of ``IMPORTED`` targets, macros and variables.

Typical usage could be something like:

 set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)
 set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)
 find_package(Qt4 4.4.3 REQUIRED QtGui QtXml)
 add_executable(myexe main.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtXml)

.. note::

 When using ``IMPORTED`` targets, the qtmain.lib static library is
 automatically linked on Windows for ``WIN32``
 executables. To disable that globally, set the
 ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` variable before finding Qt4. To disable that
 for a particular executable, set the ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` target
 property to ``TRUE`` on the executable.

Qt Build Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Qt relies on some bundled tools for code generation, such as ``moc`` for
meta-object code generation,``uic`` for widget layout and population,
and ``rcc`` for virtual filesystem content generation.  These tools may be
automatically invoked by ``cmake(1)`` if the appropriate conditions
are met.  See ``cmake-qt(7)`` for more.

Qt Macros
^^^^^^^^^

In some cases it can be necessary or useful to invoke the Qt build tools in a
more-manual way. Several macros are available to add targets for such uses.

::

 macro QT4_WRAP_CPP(outfiles inputfile ... [TARGET tgt] OPTIONS ...)
       create moc code from a list of files containing Qt class with
       the Q_OBJECT declaration.  Per-directory preprocessor definitions
       are also added.  If the <tgt> is specified, the
       INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
       the <tgt> are passed to moc.  Options may be given to moc, such as
       those found when executing "moc -help".

::

 macro QT4_WRAP_UI(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
       create code from a list of Qt designer ui files.
       Options may be given to uic, such as those found
       when executing "uic -help"

::

 macro QT4_ADD_RESOURCES(outfiles inputfile ... OPTIONS ...)
       create code from a list of Qt resource files.
       Options may be given to rcc, such as those found
       when executing "rcc -help"

::

 macro QT4_GENERATE_MOC(inputfile outputfile [TARGET tgt])
       creates a rule to run moc on infile and create outfile.
       Use this if for some reason QT4_WRAP_CPP() isn't appropriate, e.g.
       because you need a custom filename for the moc file or something
       similar.  If the <tgt> is specified, the
       INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from
       the <tgt> are passed to moc.

::

 macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE(outfiles interface basename)
       Create the interface header and implementation files with the
       given basename from the given interface xml file and add it to
       the list of sources.

       You can pass additional parameters to the qdbusxml2cpp call by setting
       properties on the input file:

       INCLUDE the given file will be included in the generate interface header

       CLASSNAME the generated class is named accordingly

       NO_NAMESPACE the generated class is not wrapped in a namespace

::

 macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACES(outfiles inputfile ... )
       Create the interface header and implementation files
       for all listed interface xml files.
       The basename will be automatically determined from the name
       of the xml file.

       The source file properties described for
       QT4_ADD_DBUS_INTERFACE also apply here.

::

 macro QT4_ADD_DBUS_ADAPTOR(outfiles xmlfile parentheader parentclassname
                            [basename] [classname])
       create a dbus adaptor (header and implementation file) from the xml file
       describing the interface, and add it to the list of sources. The adaptor
       forwards the calls to a parent class, defined in parentheader and named
       parentclassname. The name of the generated files will be
       <basename>adaptor.{cpp,h} where basename defaults to the basename of the
       xml file.
       If <classname> is provided, then it will be used as the classname of the
       adaptor itself.

::

 macro QT4_GENERATE_DBUS_INTERFACE( header [interfacename] OPTIONS ...)
       generate the xml interface file from the given header.
       If the optional argument interfacename is omitted, the name of the
       interface file is constructed from the basename of the header with
       the suffix .xml appended.
       Options may be given to qdbuscpp2xml, such as those found when
       executing "qdbuscpp2xml --help"

::

 macro QT4_CREATE_TRANSLATION( qm_files directories ... sources ...
                               ts_files ... OPTIONS ...)
       out: qm_files
       in:  directories sources ts_files
       options: flags to pass to lupdate, such as -extensions to specify
       extensions for a directory scan.
       generates commands to create .ts (vie lupdate) and .qm
       (via lrelease) - files from directories and/or sources. The ts files are
       created and/or updated in the source tree (unless given with full paths).
       The qm files are generated in the build tree.
       Updating the translations can be done by adding the qm_files
       to the source list of your library/executable, so they are
       always updated, or by adding a custom target to control when
       they get updated/generated.

::

 macro QT4_ADD_TRANSLATION( qm_files ts_files ... )
       out: qm_files
       in:  ts_files
       generates commands to create .qm from .ts - files. The generated
       filenames can be found in qm_files. The ts_files
       must exist and are not updated in any way.

::

 macro QT4_AUTOMOC(sourcefile1 sourcefile2 ... [TARGET tgt])
       The qt4_automoc macro is obsolete.  Use the CMAKE_AUTOMOC feature instead.
       This macro is still experimental.
       It can be used to have moc automatically handled.
       So if you have the files foo.h and foo.cpp, and in foo.h a
       a class uses the Q_OBJECT macro, moc has to run on it. If you don't
       want to use QT4_WRAP_CPP() (which is reliable and mature), you can insert
       #include "foo.moc"
       in foo.cpp and then give foo.cpp as argument to QT4_AUTOMOC(). This will
       scan all listed files at cmake-time for such included moc files and if it
       finds them cause a rule to be generated to run moc at build time on the
       accompanying header file foo.h.
       If a source file has the SKIP_AUTOMOC property set it will be ignored by
       this macro.
       If the <tgt> is specified, the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES and
       INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS from the <tgt> are passed to moc.

::

 function QT4_USE_MODULES( target [link_type] modules...)
        This function is obsolete. Use target_link_libraries with IMPORTED targets
        instead.
        Make <target> use the <modules> from Qt. Using a Qt module means
        to link to the library, add the relevant include directories for the
        module, and add the relevant compiler defines for using the module.
        Modules are roughly equivalent to components of Qt4, so usage would be
        something like:
         qt4_use_modules(myexe Core Gui Declarative)
        to use QtCore, QtGui and QtDeclarative. The optional <link_type> argument
        can be specified as either LINK_PUBLIC or LINK_PRIVATE to specify the
        same argument to the target_link_libraries call.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A particular Qt library may be used by using the corresponding
``IMPORTED`` target with the ``target_link_libraries()``
command:

 target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtXml)

Using a target in this way causes :cmake(1)` to use the appropriate include
directories and compile definitions for the target when compiling ``myexe``.

Targets are aware of their dependencies, so for example it is not necessary
to list ``Qt4::QtCore`` if another Qt library is listed, and it is not
necessary to list ``Qt4::QtGui`` if ``Qt4::QtDeclarative`` is listed.
Targets may be tested for existence in the usual way with the
``if(TARGET)`` command.

The Qt toolkit may contain both debug and release libraries.
``cmake(1)`` will choose the appropriate version based on the build
configuration.

``Qt4::QtCore``
 The QtCore target
``Qt4::QtGui``
 The QtGui target
``Qt4::Qt3Support``
 The Qt3Support target
``Qt4::QtAssistant``

include files and libraries are.  Ruby 1.8, 1.9, 2.0 and 2.1 are
supported.

The minimum required version of Ruby can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.  find_package(Ruby 1.8)

It also determines what the name of the library is.  This code sets
the following variables:

``RUBY_EXECUTABLE``
  full path to the ruby binary
``RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  include dirs to be used when using the ruby library
``RUBY_LIBRARY``
  full path to the ruby library
``RUBY_VERSION``

``RUBY_FOUND``
  set to true if ruby ws found successfully

Also:

``RUBY_INCLUDE_PATH``
  same as RUBY_INCLUDE_DIRS, only provided for compatibility reasons, don't use it

FindSDL_image
-------------

Locate SDL_image library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_IMAGE_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_IMAGE_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
                            version of SDL_image

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLIMAGE_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_IMAGE_LIBRARIES)
 SDLIMAGE_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_IMAGE_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLIMAGE_FOUND (same value as SDL_IMAGE_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSDL_mixer
-------------

Locate SDL_mixer library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_MIXER_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the
                            version of SDL_mixer

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLMIXER_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_MIXER_LIBRARIES)
 SDLMIXER_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLMIXER_FOUND (same value as SDL_MIXER_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSDL_net
-----------

Locate SDL_net library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_NET_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_NET_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_NET_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the version of SDL_net

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLNET_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_NET_LIBRARIES)
 SDLNET_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_NET_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLNET_FOUND (same value as SDL_NET_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSDL
-------

Locate SDL library

This module defines

::

 SDL_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL
 SDL_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL.h
 SDL_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the version of SDL

This module responds to the flag:

::

 SDL_BUILDING_LIBRARY
   If this is defined, then no SDL_main will be linked in because
   only applications need main().
   Otherwise, it is assumed you are building an application and this
   module will attempt to locate and set the proper link flags
   as part of the returned SDL_LIBRARY variable.

Don't forget to include SDLmain.h and SDLmain.m your project for the
OS X framework based version.  (Other versions link to -lSDLmain which
this module will try to find on your behalf.) Also for OS X, this
module will automatically add the -framework Cocoa on your behalf.



Additional Note: If you see an empty SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP in your
configuration and no SDL_LIBRARY, it means CMake did not find your SDL
library (SDL.dll, libsdl.so, SDL.framework, etc).  Set
SDL_LIBRARY_TEMP to point to your SDL library, and configure again.
Similarly, if you see an empty SDLMAIN_LIBRARY, you should set this
value as appropriate.  These values are used to generate the final
SDL_LIBRARY variable, but when these values are unset, SDL_LIBRARY
does not get created.



$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.  l.e.galup 9-20-02

Modified by Eric Wing.  Added code to assist with automated building
by using environmental variables and providing a more
controlled/consistent search behavior.  Added new modifications to
recognize OS X frameworks and additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL
guidelines.  Added a search for SDLmain which is needed by some
platforms.  Added a search for threads which is needed by some
platforms.  Added needed compile switches for MinGW.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
override this selection or set the CMake environment
CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH to modify the search paths.

Note that the header path has changed from SDL/SDL.h to just SDL.h
This needed to change because "proper" SDL convention is #include
"SDL.h", not <SDL/SDL.h>.  This is done for portability reasons
because not all systems place things in SDL/ (see FreeBSD).

FindSDL_sound
-------------

Locates the SDL_sound library



This module depends on SDL being found and must be called AFTER
FindSDL.cmake is called.

This module defines

::

 SDL_SOUND_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_sound.h
 SDL_SOUND_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL_sound
 SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES, this contains the list of libraries that you need
   to link against.
 SDL_SOUND_EXTRAS, this is an optional variable for you to add your own
   flags to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES. This is prepended to SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES.
   This is available mostly for cases this module failed to anticipate for
   and you must add additional flags. This is marked as ADVANCED.
 SDL_SOUND_VERSION_STRING, human-readable string containing the
   version of SDL_sound

This module also defines (but you shouldn't need to use directly)

::

 SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY, the name of just the SDL_sound library you would link
 against. Use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES for you link instructions and not this one.

And might define the following as needed

::

 MIKMOD_LIBRARY
 MODPLUG_LIBRARY
 OGG_LIBRARY
 VORBIS_LIBRARY
 SMPEG_LIBRARY
 FLAC_LIBRARY
 SPEEX_LIBRARY

Typically, you should not use these variables directly, and you should
use SDL_SOUND_LIBRARIES which contains SDL_SOUND_LIBRARY and the other
audio libraries (if needed) to successfully compile on your system.

Created by Eric Wing.  This module is a bit more complicated than the
other FindSDL* family modules.  The reason is that SDL_sound can be
compiled in a large variety of different ways which are independent of
platform.  SDL_sound may dynamically link against other 3rd party
libraries to get additional codec support, such as Ogg Vorbis, SMPEG,
ModPlug, MikMod, FLAC, Speex, and potentially others.  Under some
circumstances which I don't fully understand, there seems to be a
requirement that dependent libraries of libraries you use must also be
explicitly linked against in order to successfully compile.  SDL_sound
does not currently have any system in place to know how it was
compiled.  So this CMake module does the hard work in trying to
discover which 3rd party libraries are required for building (if any).
This module uses a brute force approach to create a test program that
uses SDL_sound, and then tries to build it.  If the build fails, it
parses the error output for known symbol names to figure out which
libraries are needed.

Responds to the $SDLDIR and $SDLSOUNDDIR environmental variable that
would correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building
SDL.

On OSX, this will prefer the Framework version (if found) over others.
People will have to manually change the cache values of SDL_LIBRARY to
override this selectionor set the CMake environment CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
to modify the search paths.

FindSDL_ttf
-----------

Locate SDL_ttf library

This module defines:

::

 SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES, the name of the library to link against
 SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS, where to find the headers
 SDL_TTF_FOUND, if false, do not try to link against
 SDL_TTF_VERSION_STRING - human-readable string containing the version of SDL_ttf

For backward compatibility the following variables are also set:

::

 SDLTTF_LIBRARY (same value as SDL_TTF_LIBRARIES)
 SDLTTF_INCLUDE_DIR (same value as SDL_TTF_INCLUDE_DIRS)
 SDLTTF_FOUND (same value as SDL_TTF_FOUND)

$SDLDIR is an environment variable that would correspond to the
./configure --prefix=$SDLDIR used in building SDL.

Created by Eric Wing.  This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake
module, but with modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).

FindSelfPackers
---------------

Find upx

This module looks for some executable packers (i.e.  software that
compress executables or shared libs into on-the-fly self-extracting
executables or shared libs.  Examples:

::

 UPX: http://wildsau.idv.uni-linz.ac.at/mfx/upx.html

FindSquish
----------

-- Typical Use



This module can be used to find Squish.  Currently Squish versions 3
and 4 are supported.

::

 SQUISH_FOUND                    If false, don't try to use Squish
 SQUISH_VERSION                  The full version of Squish found
 SQUISH_VERSION_MAJOR            The major version of Squish found
 SQUISH_VERSION_MINOR            The minor version of Squish found
 SQUISH_VERSION_PATCH            The patch version of Squish found

::

 SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR              The Squish installation directory
                                 (containing bin, lib, etc)
 SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE        The squishserver executable
 SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE        The squishrunner executable

::

 SQUISH_INSTALL_DIR_FOUND        Was the install directory found?
 SQUISH_SERVER_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the server executable found?
 SQUISH_CLIENT_EXECUTABLE_FOUND  Was the client executable found?

It provides the function squish_v4_add_test() for adding a squish test
to cmake using Squish 4.x:

::

 squish_v4_add_test(cmakeTestName
   AUT targetName SUITE suiteName TEST squishTestName
   [SETTINGSGROUP group] [PRE_COMMAND command] [POST_COMMAND command] )

The arguments have the following meaning:

``cmakeTestName``
  this will be used as the first argument for add_test()
``AUT targetName``
  the name of the cmake target which will be used as AUT, i.e. the
  executable which will be tested.
``SUITE suiteName``
  this is either the full path to the squish suite, or just the
  last directory of the suite, i.e. the suite name. In this case
  the CMakeLists.txt which calls squish_add_test() must be located
  in the parent directory of the suite directory.
``TEST squishTestName``
  the name of the squish test, i.e. the name of the subdirectory
  of the test inside the suite directory.
``SETTINGSGROUP group``
  if specified, the given settings group will be used for executing the test.
  If not specified, the groupname will be "CTest_<username>"
``PRE_COMMAND command``
  if specified, the given command will be executed before starting the squish test.
``POST_COMMAND command``
  same as PRE_COMMAND, but after the squish test has been executed.



::

 enable_testing()
 find_package(Squish 4.0)
 if (SQUISH_FOUND)
    squish_v4_add_test(myTestName
      AUT myApp
      SUITE ${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/tests/mySuite
      TEST someSquishTest
      SETTINGSGROUP myGroup
      )
 endif ()

For users of Squish version 3.x the macro squish_v3_add_test() is
provided:

::

 squish_v3_add_test(testName applicationUnderTest testCase envVars testWrapper)
 Use this macro to add a test using Squish 3.x.

::

 enable_testing()
 find_package(Squish)
 if (SQUISH_FOUND)
   squish_v3_add_test(myTestName myApplication testCase envVars testWrapper)
 endif ()

macro SQUISH_ADD_TEST(testName applicationUnderTest testCase envVars
testWrapper)

::

 This is deprecated. Use SQUISH_V3_ADD_TEST() if you are using Squish 3.x instead.

FindSQLite3
-----------

Find the SQLite libraries, v3

IMPORTED targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` target:

``SQLite::SQLite3``

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module will set the following variables if found:

``SQLite3_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  where to find sqlite3.h, etc.
``SQLite3_LIBRARIES``
  the libraries to link against to use SQLite3.
``SQLite3_VERSION``
  version of the SQLite3 library found
``SQLite3_FOUND``
  TRUE if found


FindSubversion
--------------

Extract information from a subversion working copy

The module defines the following variables:

::

 Subversion_SVN_EXECUTABLE - path to svn command line client
 Subversion_VERSION_SVN - version of svn command line client
 Subversion_FOUND - true if the command line client was found
 SUBVERSION_FOUND - same as Subversion_FOUND, set for compatibility reasons

The minimum required version of Subversion can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g. ``find_package(Subversion 1.4)``.

If the command line client executable is found two macros are defined:

::

 Subversion_WC_INFO(<dir> <var-prefix> [IGNORE_SVN_FAILURE])
 Subversion_WC_LOG(<dir> <var-prefix>)

``Subversion_WC_INFO`` extracts information of a subversion working copy at a
given location.  This macro defines the following variables if running
Subversion's ``info`` command on ``<dir>`` succeeds; otherwise a
``SEND_ERROR`` message is generated. The error can be ignored by providing the
``IGNORE_SVN_FAILURE`` option, which causes these variables to remain
undefined.

::

 <var-prefix>_WC_URL - url of the repository (at <dir>)
 <var-prefix>_WC_ROOT - root url of the repository
 <var-prefix>_WC_REVISION - current revision
 <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_AUTHOR - author of last commit
 <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_DATE - date of last commit
 <var-prefix>_WC_LAST_CHANGED_REV - revision of last commit
 <var-prefix>_WC_INFO - output of command `svn info <dir>'

``Subversion_WC_LOG`` retrieves the log message of the base revision of a
subversion working copy at a given location.  This macro defines the variable:

::

 <var-prefix>_LAST_CHANGED_LOG - last log of base revision

Example usage:

::

 find_package(Subversion)
 if(SUBVERSION_FOUND)
   Subversion_WC_INFO(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
   message("Current revision is ${Project_WC_REVISION}")
   Subversion_WC_LOG(${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR} Project)
   message("Last changed log is ${Project_LAST_CHANGED_LOG}")
 endif()

FindSWIG
--------

Find Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator (SWIG)

This module finds an installed SWIG.  It sets the following variables:

::

 SWIG_FOUND - set to "True" if SWIG is found
 SWIG_DIR - the directory where swig is installed
 SWIG_EXECUTABLE - the path to the swig executable
 SWIG_VERSION   - the version number of the swig executable

The minimum required version of SWIG can be specified using the
standard syntax, e.g.   ``find_package(SWIG 1.1)``

All information is collected from the ``SWIG_EXECUTABLE``, so the version
to be found can be changed from the command line by means of setting
``SWIG_EXECUTABLE``

FindTCL
-------

TK_INTERNAL_PATH was removed.

This module finds if Tcl is installed and determines where the include
files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 TCL_FOUND              = Tcl was found
 TK_FOUND               = Tk was found
 TCLTK_FOUND            = Tcl and Tk were found
 TCL_LIBRARY            = path to Tcl library (tcl tcl80)
 TCL_INCLUDE_PATH       = path to where tcl.h can be found
 TCL_TCLSH              = path to tclsh binary (tcl tcl80)
 TK_LIBRARY             = path to Tk library (tk tk80 etc)
 TK_INCLUDE_PATH        = path to where tk.h can be found
 TK_WISH                = full path to the wish executable

In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for
people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developers, some
variables were moved or removed.  Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:

::

 => they were only useful for people writing Tcl/Tk extensions.
 => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
    Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
    are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
    specifically (say, amongst tcl84g, tcl84gs, or tcl84sgx).
    Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
    TCL_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.
 => this ended up being only a Win32 variable, and there is a lot of
    confusion regarding the location of this file in an installed Tcl/Tk
    tree anyway (see 8.5 for example). If you need the internal path at
    this point it is safer you ask directly where the *source* tree is
    and dig from there.

FindTclsh
---------

Find tclsh

This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include
files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 TCLSH_FOUND = TRUE if tclsh has been found
 TCL_TCLSH = the path to the tclsh executable

In cygwin, look for the cygwin version first.  Don't look for it later
to avoid finding the cygwin version on a Win32 build.

FindTclStub
-----------

TCL_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG and TK_STUB_LIBRARY_DEBUG were removed.

This module finds Tcl stub libraries.  It first finds Tcl include
files and libraries by calling FindTCL.cmake.  How to Use the Tcl
Stubs Library:

::

 http://tcl.activestate.com/doc/howto/stubs.html

Using Stub Libraries:

::

 http://safari.oreilly.com/0130385603/ch48lev1sec3

This code sets the following variables:

::

 TCL_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to Tcl stub library
 TK_STUB_LIBRARY        = path to Tk stub library
 TTK_STUB_LIBRARY       = path to ttk stub library

In an effort to remove some clutter and clear up some issues for
people who are not necessarily Tcl/Tk gurus/developers, some
variables were moved or removed.  Changes compared to CMake 2.4 are:

::

 => these libs are not packaged by default with Tcl/Tk distributions.
    Even when Tcl/Tk is built from source, several flavors of debug libs
    are created and there is no real reason to pick a single one
    specifically (say, amongst tclstub84g, tclstub84gs, or tclstub84sgx).
    Let's leave that choice to the user by allowing him to assign
    TCL_STUB_LIBRARY to any Tcl library, debug or not.

FindThreads
-----------

This module determines the thread library of the system.

The following variables are set

::

 CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT     - the thread library
 CMAKE_USE_WIN32_THREADS_INIT - using WIN32 threads?
 CMAKE_USE_PTHREADS_INIT    - are we using pthreads
 CMAKE_HP_PTHREADS_INIT     - are we using hp pthreads

The following import target is created

::

 Threads::Threads

If the use of the -pthread compiler and linker flag is preferred then the
caller can set

::

 THREADS_PREFER_PTHREAD_FLAG

The compiler flag can only be used with the imported
target. Use of both the imported target as well as this switch is highly
recommended for new code.

FindTIFF
--------

Find the TIFF library (``libtiff``).

Imported targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following ``IMPORTED`` targets:

``TIFF::TIFF``
  The TIFF library, if found.

Result variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``TIFF_FOUND``
  true if the TIFF headers and libraries were found
``TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR``
  the directory containing the TIFF headers
``TIFF_INCLUDE_DIRS``
  the directory containing the TIFF headers
``TIFF_LIBRARIES``
  TIFF libraries to be linked

Cache variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following cache variables may also be set:

``TIFF_INCLUDE_DIR``
  the directory containing the TIFF headers
``TIFF_LIBRARY``
  the path to the TIFF library

FindUnixCommands
----------------

Find Unix commands, including the ones from Cygwin

This module looks for the Unix commands ``bash``, ``cp``, ``gzip``,
``mv``, ``rm``, and ``tar`` and stores the result in the variables
``BASH``, ``CP``, ``GZIP``, ``MV``, ``RM``, and ``TAR``.

FindVTK
-------

This module no longer exists.

This module existed in versions of CMake prior to 3.1, but became
only a thin wrapper around ``find_package(VTK NO_MODULE)`` to
provide compatibility for projects using long-outdated conventions.
Now ``find_package(VTK)`` will search for ``VTKConfig.cmake``
directly.

FindVulkan
----------

Find Vulkan, which is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics
and computing API.

IMPORTED Targets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines ``IMPORTED`` target ``Vulkan::Vulkan``, if
Vulkan has been found.

Result Variables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This module defines the following variables::

 Vulkan_FOUND          - "True" if Vulkan was found
 Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIRS   - include directories for Vulkan
 Vulkan_LIBRARIES      - link against this library to use Vulkan

The module will also define two cache variables::

 Vulkan_INCLUDE_DIR    - the Vulkan include directory
 Vulkan_LIBRARY        - the path to the Vulkan library

FindWget
--------

Find wget

This module looks for wget.  This module defines the following values:

::

 WGET_EXECUTABLE: the full path to the wget tool.
 WGET_FOUND: True if wget has been found.

FindWish
--------

Find wish installation

This module finds if TCL is installed and determines where the include
files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of the
library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 TK_WISH = the path to the wish executable

if UNIX is defined, then it will look for the cygwin version first

FindwxWidgets
-------------

Find a wxWidgets (a.k.a., wxWindows) installation.

This module finds if wxWidgets is installed and selects a default
configuration to use.  wxWidgets is a modular library.  To specify the
modules that you will use, you need to name them as components to the
package:

find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS core base ... OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net ...)

There are two search branches: a windows style and a unix style.  For
windows, the following variables are searched for and set to defaults
in case of multiple choices.  Change them if the defaults are not
desired (i.e., these are the only variables you should change to
select a configuration):

::

 wxWidgets_ROOT_DIR      - Base wxWidgets directory
                           (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3).
 wxWidgets_LIB_DIR       - Path to wxWidgets libraries
                           (e.g., C:/wxWidgets-2.6.3/lib/vc_lib).
 wxWidgets_CONFIGURATION - Configuration to use
                           (e.g., msw, mswd, mswu, mswunivud, etc.)
 wxWidgets_EXCLUDE_COMMON_LIBRARIES
                         - Set to TRUE to exclude linking of
                           commonly required libs (e.g., png tiff
                           jpeg zlib regex expat).

For unix style it uses the wx-config utility.  You can select between
debug/release, unicode/ansi, universal/non-universal, and
static/shared in the QtDialog or ccmake interfaces by turning ON/OFF
the following variables:

::

 wxWidgets_USE_DEBUG
 wxWidgets_USE_UNICODE
 wxWidgets_USE_UNIVERSAL
 wxWidgets_USE_STATIC

There is also a wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS variable for all other
options that need to be passed to the wx-config utility.  For example,
to use the base toolkit found in the /usr/local path, set the variable
(before calling the FIND_PACKAGE command) as such:

::

 set(wxWidgets_CONFIG_OPTIONS --toolkit=base --prefix=/usr)

The following are set after the configuration is done for both windows
and unix style:

::

 wxWidgets_FOUND            - Set to TRUE if wxWidgets was found.
 wxWidgets_INCLUDE_DIRS     - Include directories for WIN32
                              i.e., where to find "wx/wx.h" and
                              "wx/setup.h"; possibly empty for unices.
 wxWidgets_LIBRARIES        - Path to the wxWidgets libraries.
 wxWidgets_LIBRARY_DIRS     - compile time link dirs, useful for
                              rpath on UNIX. Typically an empty string
                              in WIN32 environment.
 wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS      - Contains defines required to compile/link
                              against WX, e.g. WXUSINGDLL
 wxWidgets_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG- Contains defines required to compile/link
                              against WX debug builds, e.g. __WXDEBUG__
 wxWidgets_CXX_FLAGS        - Include dirs and compiler flags for
                              unices, empty on WIN32. Essentially
                              "`wx-config --cxxflags`".
 wxWidgets_USE_FILE         - Convenience include file.

Sample usage:

::

 # Note that for MinGW users the order of libs is important!
 find_package(wxWidgets COMPONENTS gl core base OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net)
 if(wxWidgets_FOUND)
   include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
   # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
   target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})
 endif()

If wxWidgets is required (i.e., not an optional part):

::

 find_package(wxWidgets REQUIRED gl core base OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS net)
 include(${wxWidgets_USE_FILE})
 # and for each of your dependent executable/library targets:
 target_link_libraries(<YourTarget> ${wxWidgets_LIBRARIES})

Deprecated Utility Modules
==========================

CMakeDetermineVSServicePack
---------------------------

The functionality of this module has been superseded by the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` variable that contains
the compiler version number.

Determine the Visual Studio service pack of the 'cl' in use.

Usage::

 if(MSVC)
   include(CMakeDetermineVSServicePack)
   DetermineVSServicePack( my_service_pack )
   if( my_service_pack )
     message(STATUS "Detected: ${my_service_pack}")
   endif()
 endif()

Function DetermineVSServicePack sets the given variable to one of the
following values or an empty string if unknown::

 vc80, vc80sp1
 vc90, vc90sp1
 vc100, vc100sp1
 vc110, vc110sp1, vc110sp2, vc110sp3, vc110sp4

CMakeExpandImportedTargets
--------------------------

This module was once needed to expand imported targets to the underlying
libraries they reference on disk for use with the ``try_compile()``
and ``try_run()`` commands.  These commands now support imported
libraries in their ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` options (since CMake 2.8.11
for ``try_compile()`` and since CMake 3.2 for ``try_run()``).

This module does not support the policy ``CMP0022`` ``NEW``
behavior or use of the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property
because ``generator expressions``
cannot be evaluated during configuration.

::

 CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS(<var> LIBRARIES lib1 lib2...libN
                               [CONFIGURATION <config>])

CMAKE_EXPAND_IMPORTED_TARGETS() takes a list of libraries and replaces
all imported targets contained in this list with their actual file
paths of the referenced libraries on disk, including the libraries
from their link interfaces.  If a CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the
respective configuration of the imported targets if it exists.  If no
CONFIGURATION is given, it uses the first configuration from
${CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES} if set, otherwise ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}.

::

 cmake_expand_imported_targets(expandedLibs
   LIBRARIES ${CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES}
   CONFIGURATION "${CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION}" )

CMakeForceCompiler
------------------

The macros provided by this module were once intended for use by
cross-compiling toolchain files when CMake was not able to automatically
detect the compiler identification.  Since the introduction of this module,
CMake's compiler identification capabilities have improved and can now be
taught to recognize any compiler.  Furthermore, the suite of information
CMake detects from a compiler is now too extensive to be provided by
toolchain files using these macros.

One common use case for this module was to skip CMake's checks for a
working compiler when using a cross-compiler that cannot link binaries
without special flags or custom linker scripts.  This case is now supported
by setting the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` variable in the
toolchain file instead.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Macro ``CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER`` has the following signature:

::

 CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

It sets ``CMAKE_C_COMPILER`` to
the given compiler and the cmake internal variable
``CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID`` to the given
compiler-id.  It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic
compiler information tests.

Macro ``CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER`` has the following signature:

::

 CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

It sets ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER`` to
the given compiler and the cmake internal variable
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID`` to the given
compiler-id.  It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic
compiler information tests.

Macro ``CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER`` has the following signature:

::

 CMAKE_FORCE_Fortran_COMPILER(<compiler> <compiler-id>)

It sets ``CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER`` to
the given compiler and the cmake internal variable
``CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER_ID`` to the given
compiler-id.  It also bypasses the check for working compiler and basic
compiler information tests.

So a simple toolchain file could look like this:

::

 include (CMakeForceCompiler)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Generic)
 CMAKE_FORCE_C_COMPILER   (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)
 CMAKE_FORCE_CXX_COMPILER (chc12 MetrowerksHicross)

CMakeParseArguments
-------------------

This module once implemented the ``cmake_parse_arguments()`` command
that is now implemented natively by CMake.  It is now an empty placeholder
for compatibility with projects that include it to get the command from
CMake 3.4 and lower.

MacroAddFileDependencies
------------------------

MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...)

Using the macro MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES() is discouraged.  There
are usually better ways to specify the correct dependencies.

MACRO_ADD_FILE_DEPENDENCIES(<_file> depend_files...) is just a
convenience wrapper around the OBJECT_DEPENDS source file property.
You can just use set_property(SOURCE <file> APPEND PROPERTY
OBJECT_DEPENDS depend_files) instead.

TestCXXAcceptsFlag
------------------

Check if the CXX compiler accepts a flag.

 CHECK_CXX_ACCEPTS_FLAG(<flags> <variable>)

``<flags>``
 the flags to try
``<variable>``
 variable to store the result

UsePkgConfig
------------

Obsolete pkg-config module for CMake, use FindPkgConfig instead.



This module defines the following macro:

PKGCONFIG(package includedir libdir linkflags cflags)

Calling PKGCONFIG will fill the desired information into the 4 given
arguments, e.g.  PKGCONFIG(libart-2.0 LIBART_INCLUDE_DIR
LIBART_LINK_DIR LIBART_LINK_FLAGS LIBART_CFLAGS) if pkg-config was NOT
found or the specified software package doesn't exist, the variable
will be empty when the function returns, otherwise they will contain
the respective information

Use_wxWindows
-------------

This convenience include finds if wxWindows is installed and set the
appropriate libs, incdirs, flags etc.  author Jan Woetzel <jw -at-
mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de> (07/2003)

USAGE:

::

 just include Use_wxWindows.cmake
 in your projects CMakeLists.txt

include( ${CMAKE_MODULE_PATH}/Use_wxWindows.cmake)

::

 if you are sure you need GL then

set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

::

 *before* you include this file.

WriteBasicConfigVersionFile
---------------------------

::

 WRITE_BASIC_CONFIG_VERSION_FILE( filename
   [VERSION major.minor.patch]
   COMPATIBILITY (AnyNewerVersion|SameMajorVersion|SameMinorVersion|ExactVersion)
   [ARCH_INDEPENDENT]
   )

Deprecated Find Modules
=======================

FindCUDA
--------

Replacement
^^^^^^^^^^^

It is no longer necessary to use this module or call ``find_package(CUDA)``.
Instead, list ``CUDA`` among the languages named in the top-level
call to the ``project()`` command, or call the
``enable_language()`` command with ``CUDA``.
Then one can add CUDA (``.cu``) sources to programs directly
in calls to ``add_library()`` and ``add_executable()``.

Documentation of Deprecated Usage
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tools for building CUDA C files: libraries and build dependencies.

This script locates the NVIDIA CUDA C tools.  It should work on Linux,
Windows, and macOS and should be reasonably up to date with CUDA C
releases.

This script makes use of the standard ``find_package()`` arguments of
``<VERSION>``, ``REQUIRED`` and ``QUIET``.  ``CUDA_FOUND`` will report if an
acceptable version of CUDA was found.

The script will prompt the user to specify ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` if
the prefix cannot be determined by the location of nvcc in the system
path and ``REQUIRED`` is specified to ``find_package()``.  To use
a different installed version of the toolkit set the environment variable
``CUDA_BIN_PATH`` before running cmake (e.g.
``CUDA_BIN_PATH=/usr/local/cuda1.0`` instead of the default
``/usr/local/cuda``) or set ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` after configuring.  If
you change the value of ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR``, various components that
depend on the path will be relocated.

It might be necessary to set ``CUDA_TOOLKIT_ROOT_DIR`` manually on certain
platforms, or to use a CUDA runtime not installed in the default
location.  In newer versions of the toolkit the CUDA library is
included with the graphics driver -- be sure that the driver version
matches what is needed by the CUDA runtime version.

The following variables affect the behavior of the macros in the
script (in alphabetical order).  Note that any of these flags can be
changed multiple times in the same directory before calling
``CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE``, ``CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY``, ``CUDA_COMPILE``,
``CUDA_COMPILE_PTX``, ``CUDA_COMPILE_FATBIN``, ``CUDA_COMPILE_CUBIN``
or ``CUDA_WRAP_SRCS``::

 CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE (Default matches host bit size)
 -- Set to ON to compile for 64 bit device code, OFF for 32 bit device code.
    Note that making this different from the host code when generating object
    or C files from CUDA code just won't work, because size_t gets defined by
    nvcc in the generated source.  If you compile to PTX and then load the
    file yourself, you can mix bit sizes between device and host.

 CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE (Default ON)
 -- Set to ON if you want the custom build rule to be attached to the source
    file in Visual Studio.  Turn OFF if you add the same cuda file to multiple
    targets.

    This allows the user to build the target from the CUDA file; however, bad
    things can happen if the CUDA source file is added to multiple targets.
    When performing parallel builds it is possible for the custom build
    command to be run more than once and in parallel causing cryptic build
    errors.  VS runs the rules for every source file in the target, and a
    source can have only one rule no matter how many projects it is added to.
    When the rule is run from multiple targets race conditions can occur on
    the generated file.  Eventually everything will get built, but if the user
    is unaware of this behavior, there may be confusion.  It would be nice if
    this script could detect the reuse of source files across multiple targets
    and turn the option off for the user, but no good solution could be found.

 CUDA_BUILD_CUBIN (Default OFF)
 -- Set to ON to enable and extra compilation pass with the -cubin option in
    Device mode. The output is parsed and register, shared memory usage is
    printed during build.

 CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION (Default OFF for device mode)
 -- Set to ON for Emulation mode. -D_DEVICEEMU is defined for CUDA C files
    when CUDA_BUILD_EMULATION is TRUE.

 CUDA_LINK_LIBRARIES_KEYWORD (Default "")
  -- The <PRIVATE|PUBLIC|INTERFACE> keyword to use for internal
     target_link_libraries calls. The default is to use no keyword which
     uses the old "plain" form of target_link_libraries. Note that is matters
     because whatever is used inside the FindCUDA module must also be used
     outside - the two forms of target_link_libraries cannot be mixed.

 CUDA_GENERATED_OUTPUT_DIR (Default CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR)
 -- Set to the path you wish to have the generated files placed.  If it is
    blank output files will be placed in CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR.
    Intermediate files will always be placed in
    CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR/CMakeFiles.

 CUDA_HOST_COMPILATION_CPP (Default ON)
 -- Set to OFF for C compilation of host code.

 CUDA_HOST_COMPILER (Default CMAKE_C_COMPILER)
 -- Set the host compiler to be used by nvcc.  Ignored if -ccbin or
    --compiler-bindir is already present in the CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or
    CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG> variables.  For Visual Studio targets,
    the host compiler is constructed with one or more visual studio macros
    such as $(VCInstallDir), that expands out to the path when
    the command is run from within VS.
    If the CUDAHOSTCXX environment variable is set it will
    be used as the default.

 CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS
 CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
 -- Additional NVCC command line arguments.  NOTE: multiple arguments must be
    semi-colon delimited (e.g. --compiler-options;-Wall)

 CUDA_PROPAGATE_HOST_FLAGS (Default ON)
 -- Set to ON to propagate CMAKE_{C,CXX}_FLAGS and their configuration
    dependent counterparts (e.g. CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG) automatically to the
    host compiler through nvcc's -Xcompiler flag.  This helps make the
    generated host code match the rest of the system better.  Sometimes
    certain flags give nvcc problems, and this will help you turn the flag
    propagation off.  This does not affect the flags supplied directly to nvcc
    via CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS or through the OPTION flags specified through
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE, or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.  Flags used for
    shared library compilation are not affected by this flag.

 CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION (Default OFF)
 -- If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA runtime object
    files.  If used outside of CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY
    (e.g. calling CUDA_WRAP_SRCS directly),
    CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME and
    CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS should be called.

 CUDA_SOURCE_PROPERTY_FORMAT
 -- If this source file property is set, it can override the format specified
    to CUDA_WRAP_SRCS (OBJ, PTX, CUBIN, or FATBIN).  If an input source file
    is not a .cu file, setting this file will cause it to be treated as a .cu
    file. See documentation for set_source_files_properties on how to set
    this property.

 CUDA_USE_STATIC_CUDA_RUNTIME (Default ON)
 -- When enabled the static version of the CUDA runtime library will be used
    in CUDA_LIBRARIES.  If the version of CUDA configured doesn't support
    this option, then it will be silently disabled.

 CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD (Default OFF)
 -- Set to ON to see all the commands used when building the CUDA file.  When
    using a Makefile generator the value defaults to VERBOSE (run make
    VERBOSE=1 to see output), although setting CUDA_VERBOSE_BUILD to ON will
    always print the output.

The script creates the following macros (in alphabetical order)::

 CUDA_ADD_CUFFT_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
 -- Adds the cufft library to the target (can be any target).  Handles whether
    you are in emulation mode or not.

 CUDA_ADD_CUBLAS_TO_TARGET( cuda_target )
 -- Adds the cublas library to the target (can be any target).  Handles
    whether you are in emulation mode or not.

 CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                      [WIN32] [MACOSX_BUNDLE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Creates an executable "cuda_target" which is made up of the files
    specified.  All of the non CUDA C files are compiled using the standard
    build rules specified by CMAKE and the cuda files are compiled to object
    files using nvcc and the host compiler.  In addition CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRS is
    added automatically to include_directories().  Some standard CMake target
    calls can be used on the target after calling this macro
    (e.g. set_target_properties and target_link_libraries), but setting
    properties that adjust compilation flags will not affect code compiled by
    nvcc.  Such flags should be modified before calling CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_WRAP_SRCS.

 CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY( cuda_target file0 file1 ...
                   [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL] [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Same as CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE except that a library is created.

 CUDA_BUILD_CLEAN_TARGET()
 -- Creates a convenience target that deletes all the dependency files
    generated.  You should make clean after running this target to ensure the
    dependency files get regenerated.

 CUDA_COMPILE( generated_files file0 file1 ... [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE]
               [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of generated files from the input source files to be used
    with ADD_LIBRARY or ADD_EXECUTABLE.

 CUDA_COMPILE_PTX( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of PTX files generated from the input source files.

 CUDA_COMPILE_FATBIN( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of FATBIN files generated from the input source files.

 CUDA_COMPILE_CUBIN( generated_files file0 file1 ... [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- Returns a list of CUBIN files generated from the input source files.

 CUDA_COMPUTE_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECT_FILE_NAME( output_file_var
                                                      cuda_target
                                                      object_files )
 -- Compute the name of the intermediate link file used for separable
    compilation.  This file name is typically passed into
    CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS.  output_file_var is produced
    based on cuda_target the list of objects files that need separable
    compilation as specified by object_files.  If the object_files list is
    empty, then output_file_var will be empty.  This function is called
    automatically for CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY and CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE.  Note that
    this is a function and not a macro.

 CUDA_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES( path0 path1 ... )
 -- Sets the directories that should be passed to nvcc
    (e.g. nvcc -Ipath0 -Ipath1 ... ). These paths usually contain other .cu
    files.


 CUDA_LINK_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION_OBJECTS( output_file_var cuda_target
                                          nvcc_flags object_files)
 -- Generates the link object required by separable compilation from the given
    object files.  This is called automatically for CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE and
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, but can be called manually when using CUDA_WRAP_SRCS
    directly.  When called from CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY or CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE the
    nvcc_flags passed in are the same as the flags passed in via the OPTIONS
    argument.  The only nvcc flag added automatically is the bitness flag as
    specified by CUDA_64_BIT_DEVICE_CODE.  Note that this is a function
    instead of a macro.

 CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS(out_variable [target_CUDA_architectures])
 -- Selects GPU arch flags for nvcc based on target_CUDA_architectures
    target_CUDA_architectures : Auto | Common | All | LIST(ARCH_AND_PTX ...)
     - "Auto" detects local machine GPU compute arch at runtime.
     - "Common" and "All" cover common and entire subsets of architectures
    ARCH_AND_PTX : NAME | NUM.NUM | NUM.NUM(NUM.NUM) | NUM.NUM+PTX
    NAME: Fermi Kepler Maxwell Kepler+Tegra Kepler+Tesla Maxwell+Tegra Pascal
    NUM: Any number. Only those pairs are currently accepted by NVCC though:
          2.0 2.1 3.0 3.2 3.5 3.7 5.0 5.2 5.3 6.0 6.2
    Returns LIST of flags to be added to CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS in ${out_variable}
    Additionally, sets ${out_variable}_readable to the resulting numeric list
    Example:
     CUDA_SELECT_NVCC_ARCH_FLAGS(ARCH_FLAGS 3.0 3.5+PTX 5.2(5.0) Maxwell)
      LIST(APPEND CUDA_NVCC_FLAGS ${ARCH_FLAGS})

    More info on CUDA architectures: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA
    Note that this is a function instead of a macro.

 CUDA_WRAP_SRCS ( cuda_target format generated_files file0 file1 ...
                  [STATIC | SHARED | MODULE] [OPTIONS ...] )
 -- This is where all the magic happens.  CUDA_ADD_EXECUTABLE,
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY, CUDA_COMPILE, and CUDA_COMPILE_PTX all call this
    function under the hood.

    Given the list of files (file0 file1 ... fileN) this macro generates
    custom commands that generate either PTX or linkable objects (use "PTX" or
    "OBJ" for the format argument to switch).  Files that don't end with .cu
    or have the HEADER_FILE_ONLY property are ignored.

    The arguments passed in after OPTIONS are extra command line options to
    give to nvcc.  You can also specify per configuration options by
    specifying the name of the configuration followed by the options.  General
    options must precede configuration specific options.  Not all
    configurations need to be specified, only the ones provided will be used.

       OPTIONS -DFLAG=2 "-DFLAG_OTHER=space in flag"
       DEBUG -g
       RELEASE --use_fast_math
       RELWITHDEBINFO --use_fast_math;-g
       MINSIZEREL --use_fast_math

    For certain configurations (namely VS generating object files with
    CUDA_ATTACH_VS_BUILD_RULE_TO_CUDA_FILE set to ON), no generated file will
    be produced for the given cuda file.  This is because when you add the
    cuda file to Visual Studio it knows that this file produces an object file
    and will link in the resulting object file automatically.

    This script will also generate a separate cmake script that is used at
    build time to invoke nvcc.  This is for several reasons.

      1. nvcc can return negative numbers as return values which confuses
      Visual Studio into thinking that the command succeeded.  The script now
      checks the error codes and produces errors when there was a problem.

      2. nvcc has been known to not delete incomplete results when it
      encounters problems.  This confuses build systems into thinking the
      target was generated when in fact an unusable file exists.  The script
      now deletes the output files if there was an error.

      3. By putting all the options that affect the build into a file and then
      make the build rule dependent on the file, the output files will be
      regenerated when the options change.

    This script also looks at optional arguments STATIC, SHARED, or MODULE to
    determine when to target the object compilation for a shared library.
    BUILD_SHARED_LIBS is ignored in CUDA_WRAP_SRCS, but it is respected in
    CUDA_ADD_LIBRARY.  On some systems special flags are added for building
    objects intended for shared libraries.  A preprocessor macro,
    <target_name>_EXPORTS is defined when a shared library compilation is
    detected.

    Flags passed into add_definitions with -D or /D are passed along to nvcc.

The script defines the following variables::

 CUDA_VERSION_MAJOR    -- The major version of cuda as reported by nvcc.

FindPythonInterp
----------------

Find python interpreter

This module finds if Python interpreter is installed and determines
where the executables are.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 PYTHONINTERP_FOUND         - Was the Python executable found
 PYTHON_EXECUTABLE          - path to the Python interpreter

::

 PYTHON_VERSION_STRING      - Python version found e.g. 2.5.2
 PYTHON_VERSION_MAJOR       - Python major version found e.g. 2
 PYTHON_VERSION_MINOR       - Python minor version found e.g. 5
 PYTHON_VERSION_PATCH       - Python patch version found e.g. 2

The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list
of version numbers that should be taken into account when searching
for Python.  You need to set this variable before calling
find_package(PythonInterp).

If calling both ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` and
``find_package(PythonLibs)``, call ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` first to
get the currently active Python version by default with a consistent version
of PYTHON_LIBRARIES.

.. note::

  A call to ``find_package(PythonInterp ${V})`` for python version ``V``
  may find a ``python`` executable with no version suffix.  In this case
  no attempt is made to avoid python executables from other versions.
  Use ``FindPython3``, ``FindPython2`` or ``FindPython``
  instead.


FindPythonLibs
--------------

Find python libraries

This module finds if Python is installed and determines where the
include files and libraries are.  It also determines what the name of
the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 PYTHONLIBS_FOUND           - have the Python libs been found
 PYTHON_LIBRARIES           - path to the python library
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_PATH        - path to where Python.h is found (deprecated)
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS        - path to where Python.h is found
 PYTHON_DEBUG_LIBRARIES     - path to the debug library (deprecated)
 PYTHONLIBS_VERSION_STRING  - version of the Python libs found (since CMake 2.8.8)

The Python_ADDITIONAL_VERSIONS variable can be used to specify a list
of version numbers that should be taken into account when searching
for Python.  You need to set this variable before calling
find_package(PythonLibs).

If you'd like to specify the installation of Python to use, you should
modify the following cache variables:

::

 PYTHON_LIBRARY             - path to the python library
 PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR         - path to where Python.h is found

If calling both ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` and
``find_package(PythonLibs)``, call ``find_package(PythonInterp)`` first to
get the currently active Python version by default with a consistent version
of PYTHON_LIBRARIES.

FindQt
------

Searches for all installed versions of Qt3 or Qt4.

This module cannot handle Qt5 or any later versions.
For those, see ``cmake-qt(7)``.

This module exists for the ``find_package()`` command only if
policy ``CMP0084`` is not set to ``NEW``.

This module should only be used if your project can work with multiple
versions of Qt.  If not, you should just directly use FindQt4 or
FindQt3.  If multiple versions of Qt are found on the machine, then
The user must set the option DESIRED_QT_VERSION to the version they
want to use.  If only one version of qt is found on the machine, then
the DESIRED_QT_VERSION is set to that version and the matching FindQt3
or FindQt4 module is included.  Once the user sets DESIRED_QT_VERSION,
then the FindQt3 or FindQt4 module is included.

::

 QT_REQUIRED if this is set to TRUE then if CMake can
             not find Qt4 or Qt3 an error is raised
             and a message is sent to the user.

::

 DESIRED_QT_VERSION OPTION is created
 QT4_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt4 is found.
 QT3_INSTALLED is set to TRUE if qt3 is found.

FindwxWindows
-------------

Find wxWindows (wxWidgets) installation

This module finds if wxWindows/wxWidgets is installed and determines
where the include files and libraries are.  It also determines what
the name of the library is.  This code sets the following variables:

::

 WXWINDOWS_FOUND     = system has WxWindows
 WXWINDOWS_LIBRARIES = path to the wxWindows libraries
                       on Unix/Linux with additional
                       linker flags from
                       "wx-config --libs"
 CMAKE_WXWINDOWS_CXX_FLAGS  = Compiler flags for wxWindows,
                              essentially "`wx-config --cxxflags`"
                              on Linux
 WXWINDOWS_INCLUDE_DIR      = where to find "wx/wx.h" and "wx/setup.h"
 WXWINDOWS_LINK_DIRECTORIES = link directories, useful for rpath on
                               Unix
 WXWINDOWS_DEFINITIONS      = extra defines

OPTIONS If you need OpenGL support please

::

 set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)

in your CMakeLists.txt *before* you include this file.

::

 HAVE_ISYSTEM      - true required to replace -I by -isystem on g++

For convenience include Use_wxWindows.cmake in your project's
CMakeLists.txt using
include(${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/Use_wxWindows.cmake).

USAGE

::

 set(WXWINDOWS_USE_GL 1)
 find_package(wxWindows)

NOTES wxWidgets 2.6.x is supported for monolithic builds e.g.
compiled in wx/build/msw dir as:

::

 nmake -f makefile.vc BUILD=debug SHARED=0 USE_OPENGL=1 MONOLITHIC=1

DEPRECATED

::

 CMAKE_WX_CAN_COMPILE

cmake-packages(7)
*****************

Introduction
============

Packages provide dependency information to CMake based buildsystems.  Packages
are found with the ``find_package()`` command.  The result of
using ``find_package()`` is either a set of ``IMPORTED`` targets, or
a set of variables corresponding to build-relevant information.

Using Packages
==============

CMake provides direct support for two forms of packages,
Config-file Packages and Find-module Packages.
Indirect support for ``pkg-config`` packages is also provided via
the ``FindPkgConfig`` module.  In all cases, the basic form
of ``find_package()`` calls is the same:

 find_package(Qt4 4.7.0 REQUIRED) # CMake provides a Qt4 find-module
 find_package(Qt5Core 5.1.0 REQUIRED) # Qt provides a Qt5 package config file.
 find_package(LibXml2 REQUIRED) # Use pkg-config via the LibXml2 find-module

In cases where it is known that a package configuration file is provided by
upstream, and only that should be used, the ``CONFIG`` keyword may be passed
to ``find_package()``:

 find_package(Qt5Core 5.1.0 CONFIG REQUIRED)
 find_package(Qt5Gui 5.1.0 CONFIG)

Similarly, the ``MODULE`` keyword says to use only a find-module:

 find_package(Qt4 4.7.0 MODULE REQUIRED)

Specifying the type of package explicitly improves the error message shown to
the user if it is not found.

Both types of packages also support specifying components of a package,
either after the ``REQUIRED`` keyword:

 find_package(Qt5 5.1.0 CONFIG REQUIRED Widgets Xml Sql)

or as a separate ``COMPONENTS`` list:

 find_package(Qt5 5.1.0 COMPONENTS Widgets Xml Sql)

or as a separate ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`` list:

 find_package(Qt5 5.1.0 COMPONENTS Widgets
                        OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS Xml Sql
 )

Handling of ``COMPONENTS`` and ``OPTIONAL_COMPONENTS`` is defined by the
package.

By setting the ``CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>`` variable to
``TRUE``, the ``<PackageName>`` package will not be searched, and will always
be ``NOTFOUND``.

Config-file Packages
--------------------

A config-file package is a set of files provided by upstreams for downstreams
to use. CMake searches in a number of locations for package configuration files, as
described in the ``find_package()`` documentation.  The most simple way for
a CMake user to tell ``cmake(1)`` to search in a non-standard prefix for
a package is to set the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` cache variable.

Config-file packages are provided by upstream vendors as part of development
packages, that is, they belong with the header files and any other files
provided to assist downstreams in using the package.

A set of variables which provide package status information are also set
automatically when using a config-file package.  The ``<PackageName>_FOUND``
variable is set to true or false, depending on whether the package was
found.  The ``<PackageName>_DIR`` cache variable is set to the location of the
package configuration file.

Find-module Packages
--------------------

A find module is a file with a set of rules for finding the required pieces of
a dependency, primarily header files and libraries.  Typically, a find module
is needed when the upstream is not built with CMake, or is not CMake-aware
enough to otherwise provide a package configuration file.  Unlike a package configuration
file, it is not shipped with upstream, but is used by downstream to find the
files by guessing locations of files with platform-specific hints.

Unlike the case of an upstream-provided package configuration file, no single point
of reference identifies the package as being found, so the ``<PackageName>_FOUND``
variable is not automatically set by the ``find_package()`` command.  It
can still be expected to be set by convention however and should be set by
the author of the Find-module.  Similarly there is no ``<PackageName>_DIR`` variable,
but each of the artifacts such as library locations and header file locations
provide a separate cache variable.

See the ``cmake-developer(7)`` manual for more information about creating
Find-module files.

Package Layout
==============

A config-file package consists of a Package Configuration File and
optionally a Package Version File provided with the project distribution.

Package Configuration File
--------------------------

Consider a project ``Foo`` that installs the following files::

 <prefix>/include/foo-1.2/foo.h
 <prefix>/lib/foo-1.2/libfoo.a

It may also provide a CMake package configuration file::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.2/FooConfig.cmake

with content defining ``IMPORTED`` targets, or defining variables, such
as:

 # ...
 # (compute PREFIX relative to file location)
 # ...
 set(Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS ${PREFIX}/include/foo-1.2)
 set(Foo_LIBRARIES ${PREFIX}/lib/foo-1.2/libfoo.a)

If another project wishes to use ``Foo`` it need only to locate the ``FooConfig.cmake``
file and load it to get all the information it needs about package content
locations.  Since the package configuration file is provided by the package
installation it already knows all the file locations.

The ``find_package()`` command may be used to search for the package
configuration file.  This command constructs a set of installation prefixes
and searches under each prefix in several locations.  Given the name ``Foo``,
it looks for a file called ``FooConfig.cmake`` or ``foo-config.cmake``.
The full set of locations is specified in the ``find_package()`` command
documentation. One place it looks is::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/Foo*/

where ``Foo*`` is a case-insensitive globbing expression.  In our example the
globbing expression will match ``<prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.2`` and the package
configuration file will be found.

Once found, a package configuration file is immediately loaded.  It, together
with a package version file, contains all the information the project needs to
use the package.

Package Version File
--------------------

When the ``find_package()`` command finds a candidate package configuration
file it looks next to it for a version file. The version file is loaded to test
whether the package version is an acceptable match for the version requested.
If the version file claims compatibility the configuration file is accepted.
Otherwise it is ignored.

The name of the package version file must match that of the package configuration
file but has either ``-version`` or ``Version`` appended to the name before
the ``.cmake`` extension.  For example, the files::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.3/foo-config.cmake
 <prefix>/lib/cmake/foo-1.3/foo-config-version.cmake

and::

 <prefix>/lib/cmake/bar-4.2/BarConfig.cmake
 <prefix>/lib/cmake/bar-4.2/BarConfigVersion.cmake

are each pairs of package configuration files and corresponding package version
files.

When the ``find_package()`` command loads a version file it first sets the
following variables:

``PACKAGE_FIND_NAME``
 The ``<PackageName>``

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION``
 Full requested version string

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MAJOR``
 Major version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_MINOR``
 Minor version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_PATCH``
 Patch version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_TWEAK``
 Tweak version if requested, else 0

``PACKAGE_FIND_VERSION_COUNT``
 Number of version components, 0 to 4

The version file must use these variables to check whether it is compatible or
an exact match for the requested version and set the following variables with
results:

``PACKAGE_VERSION``
 Full provided version string

``PACKAGE_VERSION_EXACT``
 True if version is exact match

``PACKAGE_VERSION_COMPATIBLE``
 True if version is compatible

``PACKAGE_VERSION_UNSUITABLE``
 True if unsuitable as any version

Version files are loaded in a nested scope so they are free to set any variables
they wish as part of their computation. The find_package command wipes out the
scope when the version file has completed and it has checked the output
variables. When the version file claims to be an acceptable match for the
requested version the find_package command sets the following variables for
use by the project:

``<PackageName>_VERSION``
 Full provided version string

``<PackageName>_VERSION_MAJOR``
 Major version if provided, else 0

``<PackageName>_VERSION_MINOR``
 Minor version if provided, else 0

``<PackageName>_VERSION_PATCH``
 Patch version if provided, else 0

``<PackageName>_VERSION_TWEAK``
 Tweak version if provided, else 0

``<PackageName>_VERSION_COUNT``
 Number of version components, 0 to 4

The variables report the version of the package that was actually found.
The ``<PackageName>`` part of their name matches the argument given to the
``find_package()`` command.

Creating Packages
=================

Usually, the upstream depends on CMake itself and can use some CMake facilities
for creating the package files. Consider an upstream which provides a single
shared library:

 project(UpstreamLib)

 set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR ON)
 set(CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE ON)

 set(Upstream_VERSION 3.4.1)

 include(GenerateExportHeader)

 add_library(ClimbingStats SHARED climbingstats.cpp)
 generate_export_header(ClimbingStats)
 set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats PROPERTY VERSION ${Upstream_VERSION})
 set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats PROPERTY SOVERSION 3)
 set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats PROPERTY
   INTERFACE_ClimbingStats_MAJOR_VERSION 3)
 set_property(TARGET ClimbingStats APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING ClimbingStats_MAJOR_VERSION
 )

 install(TARGETS ClimbingStats EXPORT ClimbingStatsTargets
   LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
   ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
   RUNTIME DESTINATION bin
   INCLUDES DESTINATION include
 )
 install(
   FILES
     climbingstats.h
     "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/climbingstats_export.h"
   DESTINATION
     include
   COMPONENT
     Devel
 )

 include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)
 write_basic_package_version_file(
   "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsConfigVersion.cmake"
   VERSION ${Upstream_VERSION}
   COMPATIBILITY AnyNewerVersion
 )

 export(EXPORT ClimbingStatsTargets
   FILE "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake"
   NAMESPACE Upstream::
 )
 configure_file(cmake/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake
   "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake"
   COPYONLY
 )

 set(ConfigPackageLocation lib/cmake/ClimbingStats)
 install(EXPORT ClimbingStatsTargets
   FILE
     ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake
   NAMESPACE
     Upstream::
   DESTINATION
     ${ConfigPackageLocation}
 )
 install(
   FILES
     cmake/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake
     "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/ClimbingStats/ClimbingStatsConfigVersion.cmake"
   DESTINATION
     ${ConfigPackageLocation}
   COMPONENT
     Devel
 )

The ``CMakePackageConfigHelpers`` module provides a macro for creating
a simple ``ConfigVersion.cmake`` file.  This file sets the version of the
package.  It is read by CMake when ``find_package()`` is called to
determine the compatibility with the requested version, and to set some
version-specific variables ``<PackageName>_VERSION``, ``<PackageName>_VERSION_MAJOR``,
``<PackageName>_VERSION_MINOR`` etc.  The ``install(EXPORT)`` command is
used to export the targets in the ``ClimbingStatsTargets`` export-set, defined
previously by the ``install(TARGETS)`` command. This command generates
the ``ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake`` file to contain ``IMPORTED``
targets, suitable for use by downstreams and arranges to install it to
``lib/cmake/ClimbingStats``.  The generated ``ClimbingStatsConfigVersion.cmake``
and a ``cmake/ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake`` are installed to the same location,
completing the package.

The generated ``IMPORTED`` targets have appropriate properties set
to define their :ref:`usage requirements <Target Usage Requirements>`, such as
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``,
``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and other relevant built-in
``INTERFACE_`` properties.  The ``INTERFACE`` variant of user-defined
properties listed in ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING`` and
other :ref:`Compatible Interface Properties` are also propagated to the
generated ``IMPORTED`` targets.  In the above case,
``ClimbingStats_MAJOR_VERSION`` is defined as a string which must be
compatible among the dependencies of any depender.  By setting this custom
defined user property in this version and in the next version of
``ClimbingStats``, ``cmake(1)`` will issue a diagnostic if there is an
attempt to use version 3 together with version 4.  Packages can choose to
employ such a pattern if different major versions of the package are designed
to be incompatible.

A ``NAMESPACE`` with double-colons is specified when exporting the targets
for installation.  This convention of double-colons gives CMake a hint that
the name is an ``IMPORTED`` target when it is used by downstreams
with the ``target_link_libraries()`` command.  This way, CMake can
issue a diagnostic if the package providing it has not yet been found.

In this case, when using ``install(TARGETS)`` the ``INCLUDES DESTINATION``
was specified.  This causes the ``IMPORTED`` targets to have their
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` populated with the ``include``
directory in the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.  When the ``IMPORTED``
target is used by downstream, it automatically consumes the entries from
that property.

Creating a Package Configuration File
-------------------------------------

In this case, the ``ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake`` file could be as simple as:

 include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake")

As this allows downstreams to use the ``IMPORTED`` targets.  If any macros
should be provided by the ``ClimbingStats`` package, they should
be in a separate file which is installed to the same location as the
``ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake`` file, and included from there.

This can also be extended to cover dependencies:

 # ...
 add_library(ClimbingStats SHARED climbingstats.cpp)
 generate_export_header(ClimbingStats)

 find_package(Stats 2.6.4 REQUIRED)
 target_link_libraries(ClimbingStats PUBLIC Stats::Types)

As the ``Stats::Types`` target is a ``PUBLIC`` dependency of ``ClimbingStats``,
downstreams must also find the ``Stats`` package and link to the ``Stats::Types``
library.  The ``Stats`` package should be found in the ``ClimbingStatsConfig.cmake``
file to ensure this.  The ``find_dependency`` macro from the
``CMakeFindDependencyMacro`` helps with this by propagating
whether the package is ``REQUIRED``, or ``QUIET`` etc.  All ``REQUIRED``
dependencies of a package should be found in the ``Config.cmake`` file:

 include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
 find_dependency(Stats 2.6.4)

 include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake")
 include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsMacros.cmake")

The ``find_dependency`` macro also sets ``ClimbingStats_FOUND`` to ``False`` if
the dependency is not found, along with a diagnostic that the ``ClimbingStats``
package can not be used without the ``Stats`` package.

If ``COMPONENTS`` are specified when the downstream uses ``find_package()``,
they are listed in the ``<PackageName>_FIND_COMPONENTS`` variable. If a particular
component is non-optional, then the ``<PackageName>_FIND_REQUIRED_<comp>`` will
be true. This can be tested with logic in the package configuration file:

 include(CMakeFindDependencyMacro)
 find_dependency(Stats 2.6.4)

 include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsTargets.cmake")
 include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStatsMacros.cmake")

 set(_supported_components Plot Table)

 foreach(_comp ${ClimbingStats_FIND_COMPONENTS})
   if (NOT ";${_supported_components};" MATCHES _comp)
     set(ClimbingStats_FOUND False)
     set(ClimbingStats_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE "Unsupported component: ${_comp}")
   endif()
   include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/ClimbingStats${_comp}Targets.cmake")
 endforeach()

Here, the ``ClimbingStats_NOT_FOUND_MESSAGE`` is set to a diagnosis that the package
could not be found because an invalid component was specified.  This message
variable can be set for any case where the ``_FOUND`` variable is set to ``False``,
and will be displayed to the user.

Creating a Package Configuration File for the Build Tree
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``export(EXPORT)`` command creates an ``IMPORTED`` targets
definition file which is specific to the build-tree, and is not relocatable.
This can similarly be used with a suitable package configuration file and
package version file to define a package for the build tree which may be used
without installation.  Consumers of the build tree can simply ensure that the
``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` contains the build directory, or set the
``ClimbingStats_DIR`` to ``<build_dir>/ClimbingStats`` in the cache.

Creating Relocatable Packages
-----------------------------

A relocatable package must not reference absolute paths of files on
the machine where the package is built that will not exist on the
machines where the package may be installed.

Packages created by ``install(EXPORT)`` are designed to be relocatable,
using paths relative to the location of the package itself.  When defining
the interface of a target for ``EXPORT``, keep in mind that the include
directories should be specified as relative paths which are relative to the
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``:

 target_include_directories(tgt INTERFACE
   # Wrong, not relocatable:
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX}/include/TgtName>
 )

 target_include_directories(tgt INTERFACE
   # Ok, relocatable:
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/TgtName>
 )

The ``$<INSTALL_PREFIX>``
``generator expression`` may be used as
a placeholder for the install prefix without resulting in a non-relocatable
package.  This is necessary if complex generator expressions are used:

 target_include_directories(tgt INTERFACE
   # Ok, relocatable:
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:$<INSTALL_PREFIX>/include/TgtName>>
 )

This also applies to paths referencing external dependencies.
It is not advisable to populate any properties which may contain
paths, such as ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` and
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``, with paths relevant to dependencies.
For example, this code may not work well for a relocatable package:

 target_link_libraries(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
   ${Foo_LIBRARIES} ${Bar_LIBRARIES}
   )
 target_include_directories(ClimbingStats INTERFACE
   "$<INSTALL_INTERFACE:${Foo_INCLUDE_DIRS};${Bar_INCLUDE_DIRS}>"
   )

The referenced variables may contain the absolute paths to libraries
and include directories **as found on the machine the package was made on**.
This would create a package with hard-coded paths to dependencies and not
suitable for relocation.

Ideally such dependencies should be used through their own
:ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>` that have their own
``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` and usage requirement properties
such as ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` populated
appropriately.  Those imported targets may then be used with
the ``target_link_libraries()`` command for ``ClimbingStats``:

 target_link_libraries(ClimbingStats INTERFACE Foo::Foo Bar::Bar)

With this approach the package references its external dependencies
only through the names of :ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>`.
When a consumer uses the installed package, the consumer will run the
appropriate ``find_package()`` commands (via the ``find_dependency``
macro described above) to find the dependencies and populate the
imported targets with appropriate paths on their own machine.

Unfortunately many ``modules`` shipped with
CMake do not yet provide :ref:`IMPORTED targets <Imported Targets>`
because their development pre-dated this approach.  This may improve
incrementally over time.  Workarounds to create relocatable packages
using such modules include:

* When building the package, specify each ``Foo_LIBRARY`` cache
  entry as just a library name, e.g. ``-DFoo_LIBRARY=foo``.  This
  tells the corresponding find module to populate the ``Foo_LIBRARIES``
  with just ``foo`` to ask the linker to search for the library
  instead of hard-coding a path.

* Or, after installing the package content but before creating the
  package installation binary for redistribution, manually replace
  the absolute paths with placeholders for substitution by the
  installation tool when the package is installed.

Package Registry
================

CMake provides two central locations to register packages that have
been built or installed anywhere on a system:

* User Package Registry
* System Package Registry

The registries are especially useful to help projects find packages in
non-standard install locations or directly in their own build trees.
A project may populate either the user or system registry (using its own
means, see below) to refer to its location.
In either case the package should store at the registered location a
Package Configuration File (``<PackageName>Config.cmake``) and optionally a
Package Version File (``<PackageName>ConfigVersion.cmake``).

The ``find_package()`` command searches the two package registries
as two of the search steps specified in its documentation.  If it has
sufficient permissions it also removes stale package registry entries
that refer to directories that do not exist or do not contain a matching
package configuration file.

User Package Registry
---------------------

The User Package Registry is stored in a per-user location.
The ``export(PACKAGE)`` command may be used to register a project
build tree in the user package registry.  CMake currently provides no
interface to add install trees to the user package registry.  Installers
must be manually taught to register their packages if desired.

On Windows the user package registry is stored in the Windows registry
under a key in ``HKEY_CURRENT_USER``.

A ``<PackageName>`` may appear under registry key::

 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<PackageName>

as a ``REG_SZ`` value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the directory
containing the package configuration file.

On UNIX platforms the user package registry is stored in the user home
directory under ``~/.cmake/packages``.  A ``<PackageName>`` may appear under
the directory::

 ~/.cmake/packages/<PackageName>

as a file, with arbitrary name, whose content specifies the directory
containing the package configuration file.

System Package Registry
-----------------------

The System Package Registry is stored in a system-wide location.
CMake currently provides no interface to add to the system package registry.
Installers must be manually taught to register their packages if desired.

On Windows the system package registry is stored in the Windows registry
under a key in ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE``.  A ``<PackageName>`` may appear under
registry key::

 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<PackageName>

as a ``REG_SZ`` value, with arbitrary name, that specifies the directory
containing the package configuration file.

There is no system package registry on non-Windows platforms.

Disabling the Package Registry
------------------------------

In some cases using the Package Registries is not desirable. CMake
allows one to disable them using the following variables:

* The ``export(PACKAGE)`` command does not populate the user
  package registry when ``CMP0090`` is set to ``NEW`` unless the
  ``CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable explicitly enables it.
  When ``CMP0090`` is *not* set to ``NEW`` then
  ``export(PACKAGE)`` populates the user package registry unless
  the ``CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable explicitly
  disables it.
* ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` disables the
  User Package Registry in all the ``find_package()`` calls when
  set to ``FALSE``.
* Deprecated ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` disables the
  User Package Registry in all the ``find_package()`` calls when set
  to ``TRUE``. This variable is ignored when
  ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` has been set.
* ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` disables
  the System Package Registry in all the ``find_package()`` calls.

Package Registry Example
------------------------

A simple convention for naming package registry entries is to use content
hashes.  They are deterministic and unlikely to collide
(``export(PACKAGE)`` uses this approach).
The name of an entry referencing a specific directory is simply the content
hash of the directory path itself.

If a project arranges for package registry entries to exist, such as::

 > reg query HKCU\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\MyPackage
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\MyPackage
  45e7d55f13b87179bb12f907c8de6fc4 REG_SZ c:/Users/Me/Work/lib/cmake/MyPackage
  7b4a9844f681c80ce93190d4e3185db9 REG_SZ c:/Users/Me/Work/MyPackage-build

or::

 $ cat ~/.cmake/packages/MyPackage/7d1fb77e07ce59a81bed093bbee945bd
 /home/me/work/lib/cmake/MyPackage
 $ cat ~/.cmake/packages/MyPackage/f92c1db873a1937f3100706657c63e07
 /home/me/work/MyPackage-build

then the ``CMakeLists.txt`` code:

 find_package(MyPackage)

will search the registered locations for package configuration files
(``MyPackageConfig.cmake``).  The search order among package registry
entries for a single package is unspecified and the entry names
(hashes in this example) have no meaning.  Registered locations may
contain package version files (``MyPackageConfigVersion.cmake``) to
tell ``find_package()`` whether a specific location is suitable
for the version requested.

Package Registry Ownership
--------------------------

Package registry entries are individually owned by the project installations
that they reference.  A package installer is responsible for adding its own
entry and the corresponding uninstaller is responsible for removing it.

The ``export(PACKAGE)`` command populates the user package registry
with the location of a project build tree.  Build trees tend to be deleted by
developers and have no "uninstall" event that could trigger removal of their
entries.  In order to keep the registries clean the ``find_package()``
command automatically removes stale entries it encounters if it has sufficient
permissions.  CMake provides no interface to remove an entry referencing an
existing build tree once ``export(PACKAGE)`` has been invoked.
However, if the project removes its package configuration file from the build
tree then the entry referencing the location will be considered stale.

cmake-policies(7)
*****************

Introduction
============

Policies in CMake are used to preserve backward compatible behavior
across multiple releases.  When a new policy is introduced, newer CMake
versions will begin to warn about the backward compatible behavior.  It
is possible to disable the warning by explicitly requesting the OLD, or
backward compatible behavior using the ``cmake_policy()`` command.
It is also possible to request ``NEW``, or non-backward compatible behavior
for a policy, also avoiding the warning.  Each policy can also be set to
either ``NEW`` or ``OLD`` behavior explicitly on the command line with the
``CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>`` variable.

A policy is a deprecation mechanism and not a reliable feature toggle.
A policy should almost never be set to ``OLD``, except to silence warnings
in an otherwise frozen or stable codebase, or temporarily as part of a
larger migration path. The ``OLD`` behavior of each policy is undesirable
and will be replaced with an error condition in a future release.

The ``cmake_minimum_required()`` command does more than report an
error if a too-old version of CMake is used to build a project.  It
also sets all policies introduced in that CMake version or earlier to
``NEW`` behavior.  To manage policies without increasing the minimum required
CMake version, the ``if(POLICY)`` command may be used:

 if(POLICY CMP0990)
   cmake_policy(SET CMP0990 NEW)
 endif()

This has the effect of using the ``NEW`` behavior with newer CMake releases which
users may be using and not issuing a compatibility warning.

The setting of a policy is confined in some cases to not propagate to the
parent scope.  For example, if the files read by the ``include()`` command
or the ``find_package()`` command contain a use of ``cmake_policy()``,
that policy setting will not affect the caller by default.  Both commands accept
an optional ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` keyword to control this behavior.

The ``CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION`` variable may also be used
to determine whether to report an error on use of deprecated macros or
functions.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.16
=================================

CMP0097
-------

``ExternalProject_Add()`` with ``GIT_SUBMODULES ""`` initializes no
submodules.

The module provides a ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option which controls what submodules
to initialize and update. Starting with CMake 3.16, explicitly setting
``GIT_SUBMODULES`` to an empty string means no submodules will be initialized
or updated.

This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to
an empty string to initialize and update all git submodules.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to
an empty string to initialize and update no git submodules.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.16.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

CMP0096
-------

The ``project()`` command preserves leading zeros in version components.

When a ``VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]`` argument is given
to the ``project()`` command, it stores the version string in the
``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable and stores individual integer version components
in ``PROJECT_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH,TWEAK}`` variables (see policy
``CMP0048``).  CMake 3.15 and below dropped leading zeros from each
component.  CMake 3.16 and higher prefer to preserve leading zeros.  This
policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to
expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy drops leading zeros in all components,
e.g.  such that version ``1.07.06`` becomes ``1.7.6``.  The ``NEW`` behavior
of this policy preserves the leading zeros in all components, such that
version ``1.07.06`` remains unchanged.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.16.  Unlike many policies, CMake
version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn when this policy is not set and simply uses
the ``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to
``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0095
-------

``RPATH`` entries are properly escaped in the intermediary CMake install script.

In CMake 3.15 and earlier, ``RPATH`` entries set via
``CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH`` or via ``INSTALL_RPATH`` have not been
escaped before being inserted into the ``cmake_install.cmake`` script. Dynamic
linkers on ELF-based systems (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD) allow certain keywords in
``RPATH`` entries, such as ``${ORIGIN}`` (More details are available in the
``ld.so`` man pages on those systems). The syntax of these keywords can match
CMake's variable syntax. In order to not be substituted (usually to an empty
string) already by the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script, the user had
to double-escape such ``RPATH`` keywords, e.g.
``set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH "\\\${ORIGIN}/../lib")``. Since the intermediary
``cmake_install.cmake`` script is an implementation detail of CMake, CMake 3.16
and later will make sure ``RPATH`` entries are inserted literally by escaping
any coincidental CMake syntax.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to not escape ``RPATH`` entries in the
intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script. The ``NEW`` behavior is to properly
escape coincidental CMake syntax in ``RPATH`` entries when generating the
intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.16. CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns
when the policy is not set and detected usage of CMake-like syntax and uses
``OLD`` behavior. Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD``
or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.15
=================================

CMP0094
-------

Modules ``FindPython3``, ``FindPython2`` and ``FindPython``
use ``LOCATION`` for lookup strategy.

Starting with CMake 3.15, Modules ``FindPython3``, ``FindPython2``
and ``FindPython`` set value ``LOCATION`` for, respectively, variables
``Python3_FIND_STRATEGY``, ``Python2_FIND_STRATEGY`` and
``Python_FIND_STRATEGY``. This policy provides compatibility with projects that
expect the legacy behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy set value ``VERSION`` for variables
``Python3_FIND_STRATEGY``, ``Python2_FIND_STRATEGY`` and
``Python_FIND_STRATEGY``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses the ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0093
-------

``FindBoost`` reports ``Boost_VERSION`` in ``x.y.z`` format.

In CMake 3.14 and below the module would report the Boost version
number as specified in the preprocessor definition ``BOOST_VERSION`` in
the ``boost/version.hpp`` file. In CMake 3.15 and later it is preferred
that the reported version number matches the ``x.y.z`` format reported
by the CMake package shipped with Boost ``1.70.0`` and later. The macro
value is still reported in the ``Boost_VERSION_MACRO`` variable.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``FindBoost`` to report
``Boost_VERSION`` as specified in the preprocessor definition
``BOOST_VERSION`` in ``boost/version.hpp``. The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is for ``FindBoost`` to report ``Boost_VERSION`` in
``x.y.z`` format.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses the ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0092
-------

MSVC warning flags are not in ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` by default.

When using MSVC-like compilers in CMake 3.14 and below, warning flags
like ``/W3`` are added to ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` by default.
This is problematic for projects that want to choose a different warning
level programmatically.  In particular, it requires string editing of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` variables with knowledge of the
CMake builtin defaults so they can be replaced.

CMake 3.15 and above prefer to leave out warning flags from the value of
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` by default.

This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated
to expect the lack of warning flags.  The policy setting takes effect as of
the first ``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command that
initializes ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` for a given lanuage ``<LANG>``.

.. note::

  Once the policy has taken effect at the top of a project for a given
  language, that choice must be used throughout the tree for that language.
  In projects that have nested projects in subdirectories, be sure to
  convert everything together.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to place MSVC warning flags in the
default ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` cache entries.  The ``NEW`` behavior
for this policy is to *not* place MSVC warning flags in the default cache
entries.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0091
-------

MSVC runtime library flags are selected by an abstraction.

Compilers targeting the MSVC ABI have flags to select the MSVC runtime library.
Runtime library selection typically varies with build configuration because
there is a separate runtime library for Debug builds.

In CMake 3.14 and below, MSVC runtime library selection flags are added to
the default ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` cache entries by CMake
automatically.  This allows users to edit their cache entries to adjust the
flags.  However, the presence of such default flags is problematic for
projects that want to choose a different runtime library programmatically.
In particular, it requires string editing of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` variables with knowledge of the
CMake builtin defaults so they can be replaced.

CMake 3.15 and above prefer to leave the MSVC runtime library selection flags
out of the default ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` values and instead
offer a first-class abstraction.  The ``CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY``
variable and ``MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`` target property may be set to
select the MSVC runtime library.  If they are not set then CMake uses the
default value ``MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>DLL`` which is
equivalent to the original flags.

This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated
to be aware of the abstraction.  The policy setting takes effect as of the
first ``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command that enables
a language whose compiler targets the MSVC ABI.

.. note::

  Once the policy has taken effect at the top of a project, that choice
  must be used throughout the tree.  In projects that have nested projects
  in subdirectories, be sure to convert everything together.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to place MSVC runtime library
flags in the default ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` cache
entries and ignore the ``CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`` abstraction.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to *not* place MSVC runtime
library flags in the default cache entries and use the abstraction instead.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike many policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0090
-------

``export(PACKAGE)`` does not populate package registry by default.

In CMake 3.14 and below the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command populated the
user package registry by default and users needed to set the
``CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` to disable it, e.g. in automated
build and packaging environments.  Since the user package registry is stored
outside the build tree, this side effect should not be enabled by default.
Therefore CMake 3.15 and above prefer that ``export(PACKAGE)`` does
nothing unless an explicit ``CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable
is set to enable it.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that
have not been updated.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``export(PACKAGE)`` command
to populate the user package registry unless
``CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is enabled.
The ``NEW`` behavior is for ``export(PACKAGE)`` command to do nothing
unless the ``CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is enabled.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0089
-------

Compiler id for IBM Clang-based XL compilers is now ``XLClang``.

CMake 3.15 and above recognize that IBM's Clang-based XL compilers
that define ``__ibmxl__`` are a new front-end distinct from ``xlc``
with a different command line and set of capabilities.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable to ``XLClang`` instead
of ``XL``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
Clang-based XL is just ``XL`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.15.
Therefore this policy determines for Clang-based XL compilers which
compiler id to report in the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID``
variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the ``project()``
or ``enable_language()`` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``XL``.  The
``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``XLClang``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.15.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set this policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
by default when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0089``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.14
=================================

CMP0088
-------

``FindBISON`` runs bison in ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``
when executing.

The module provides a ``BISON_TARGET`` macro which generates BISON output.
In CMake 3.13 and below the macro would generate a custom command that runs
``bison`` in the source directory.  CMake 3.14 and later prefer to run it
in the build directory and use ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` as the
``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` of its ``add_custom_command()`` invocation.
This ensures that any implicitly generated file is written to the build
tree rather than the source.

This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated
to expect the new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``BISON_TARGET`` to use
the current source directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where
to generate implicit files. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to
use the current binary directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where
to generate implicit files.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0087
-------

``install(CODE)`` and ``install(SCRIPT)`` support generator
expressions.

In CMake 3.13 and earlier, ``install(CODE)`` and
``install(SCRIPT)`` did not evaluate generator expressions.  CMake 3.14
and later will evaluate generator expressions for ``install(CODE)`` and
``install(SCRIPT)``.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``install(CODE)`` and
``install(SCRIPT)`` to not evaluate generator expressions.  The ``NEW``
behavior is to evaluate generator expressions for ``install(CODE)`` and
``install(SCRIPT)``.

Note that it is the value of this policy setting at the end of the directory
scope that is important, not its setting at the time of the call to
``install(CODE)`` or ``install(SCRIPT)``.  This has implications
for calling these commands from places that have their own policy scope but not
their own directory scope (e.g. from files brought in via ``include()``
rather than ``add_subdirectory()``).

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0086
-------

``UseSWIG`` honors ``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` via ``-module`` flag.

Starting with CMake 3.14, ``UseSWIG`` passes option
``-module <module_name>`` to ``SWIG`` compiler if the file property
``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` is specified. This policy provides compatibility with
projects that expect the legacy behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to never pass ``-module`` option.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to pass ``-module`` option to ``SWIG`` compiler if
``SWIG_MODULE_NAME`` is specified.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

-------

``$<IN_LIST:...>`` handles empty list items.

In CMake 3.13 and lower, the ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` generator expression always
returned ``0`` if the first argument was empty, even if the list contained an
empty item. This behavior is inconsistent with the ``IN_LIST`` behavior of
``if()``, which this generator expression is meant to emulate. CMake 3.14
and later handles this case correctly.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` to always return
``0`` if the first argument is empty. The ``NEW`` behavior is to return ``1``
if the first argument is empty and the list contains an empty item.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0084
-------

The ``FindQt`` module does not exist for ``find_package()``.

The existence of ``FindQt`` means that for Qt upstream to provide
package config files that can be found by ``find_package(Qt)``, the consuming
project has to explicitly specify ``find_package(Qt CONFIG)``. Removing this
module gives Qt a path forward for exporting its own config files which can
easily be found by consuming projects.

This policy pretends that CMake's internal ``FindQt`` module does not
exist for ``find_package()``. If a project really wants to use Qt 3 or 4,
it can call ``find_package(Qt[34])``, ``include(FindQt)``, or add
``FindQt`` to their ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``FindQt`` to exist for
``find_package()``. The ``NEW`` behavior is to pretend that it doesn't
exist for ``find_package()``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

CMP0083
-------

To control generation of Position Independent Executable (``PIE``) or not, some
flags are required at link time.

CMake 3.13 and lower did not add these link flags when
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` is set.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not manage ``PIE`` link flags. The
``NEW`` behavior is to add link flags if ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``
is set:

* Set to ``TRUE``: flags to produce a position independent executable are
  passed to the linker step. For example ``-pie`` for ``GCC``.
* Set to ``FALSE``: flags not to produce a position independent executable are
  passed to the linker step. For example ``-no-pie`` for ``GCC``.
* Not set: no flags are passed to the linker step.

Since a given linker may not support ``PIE`` flags in all environments in
which it is used, it is the project's responsibility to use the
``CheckPIESupported`` module to check for support to ensure that the
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target property for executables will be
honored at link time.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14. Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does not warn when this policy is
not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Behave like CMake 3.13 and do not apply any ``PIE`` flags at link stage.

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.13)
 project(foo)

 # ...

 add_executable(foo ...)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)

Use the ``CheckPIESupported`` module to detect whether ``PIE`` is
supported by the current linker and environment.  Apply ``PIE`` flags only
if the linker supports them.

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14) # CMP0083 NEW
 project(foo)

 include(CheckPIESupported)
 check_pie_supported()

 # ...

 add_executable(foo ...)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE TRUE)

CMP0082
-------

Install rules from ``add_subdirectory()`` calls are interleaved with
those in caller.

CMake 3.13 and lower ran the install rules from ``add_subdirectory()``
after all other install rules, even if ``add_subdirectory()`` was called
before the other install rules.  CMake 3.14 and above prefer to interleave
these ``add_subdirectory()`` install rules with the others so that
they are run in the order they are declared.  This policy provides
compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the
new behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to run the install rules from
``add_subdirectory()`` after the other install rules.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to run all install rules in the order they are
declared.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.14.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0082``
variable to control the warning.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.13
=================================

CMP0081
-------

Relative paths not allowed in ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` target property.

CMake 3.12 and lower allowed the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` directory
property to contain relative paths.  The base path for such relative
entries is not well defined.  CMake 3.13 and later will issue a
``FATAL_ERROR`` if the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` target property
(which is initialized by the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` directory property)
contains a relative path.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is not to warn about relative paths
in the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` target property.  The ``NEW`` behavior for
this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``
contains a relative path.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0080
-------

``BundleUtilities`` cannot be included at configure time.

The macros provided by ``BundleUtilities`` are intended to be invoked
at install time rather than at configure time, because they depend on the
listed targets already existing at the time they are invoked. If they are
invoked at configure time, the targets haven't been built yet, and the
commands will fail.

This policy restricts the inclusion of ``BundleUtilities`` to
``cmake -P`` style scripts and install rules. Specifically, it looks for the
presence of ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` and throws a fatal error if it exists.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to allow ``BundleUtilities`` to
be included at configure time. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to
disallow such inclusion.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0079
-------

``target_link_libraries()`` allows use with targets in other directories.

Prior to CMake 3.13 the ``target_link_libraries()`` command did not
accept targets not created in the calling directory as its first argument
for calls that update the ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` of the target itself.
It did accidentally accept targets from other directories on calls that
only update the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``, but would simply
add entries to the property as if the call were made in the original
directory.  Thus link interface libraries specified this way were always
looked up by generators in the scope of the original target rather than
in the scope that called ``target_link_libraries()``.

CMake 3.13 now allows the ``target_link_libraries()`` command to
be called from any directory to add link dependencies and link interface
libraries to targets created in other directories.  The entries are added
to ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` and ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
using a special (internal) suffix to tell the generators to look up the
names in the calling scope rather than the scope that created the target.

This policy provides compatibility with projects that already use
``target_link_libraries()`` with the ``INTERFACE`` keyword
on a target in another directory to add ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
entries to be looked up in the target's directory.  Such projects should
be updated to be aware of the new scoping rules in that case.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to disallow
``target_link_libraries()`` calls naming targets from another directory
except in the previously accidentally allowed case of using the ``INTERFACE``
keyword only.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to allow all such
calls but use the new scoping rules.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0078
-------

``UseSWIG`` generates standard target names.

Starting with CMake 3.13, ``UseSWIG`` generates now standard target
names. This policy provides compatibility with projects that expect the legacy
behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy relies on
``UseSWIG_TARGET_NAME_PREFERENCE`` variable that can be used to specify an
explicit preference.  The value may be one of:

* ``LEGACY``: legacy strategy is applied. Variable
  ``SWIG_MODULE_<name>_REAL_NAME`` must be used to get real target name.
  This is the default if not specified.
* ``STANDARD``: target name matches specified name.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0077
-------

``option()`` honors normal variables.

The ``option()`` command is typically used to create a cache entry
to allow users to set the option.  However, there are cases in which a
normal (non-cached) variable of the same name as the option may be
defined by the project prior to calling the ``option()`` command.
For example, a project that embeds another project as a subdirectory
may want to hard-code options of the subproject to build the way it needs.

For historical reasons in CMake 3.12 and below the ``option()``
command *removes* a normal (non-cached) variable of the same name when:

* a cache entry of the specified name does not exist at all, or
* a cache entry of the specified name exists but has not been given
  a type (e.g. via ``-D<name>=ON`` on the command line).

In both of these cases (typically on the first run in a new build tree),
the ``option()`` command gives the cache entry type ``BOOL`` and
removes any normal (non-cached) variable of the same name.  In the
remaining case that the cache entry of the specified name already
exists and has a type (typically on later runs in a build tree), the
``option()`` command changes nothing and any normal variable of
the same name remains set.

In CMake 3.13 and above the ``option()`` command prefers to
do nothing when a normal variable of the given name already exists.
It does not create or update a cache entry or remove the normal variable.
The new behavior is consistent between the first and later runs in a
build tree.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have
not been updated to expect the new behavior.

When the ``option()`` command sees a normal variable of the given
name:

* The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to proceed even when a normal
  variable of the same name exists.  If the cache entry does not already
  exist and have a type then it is created and/or given a type and the
  normal variable is removed.

* The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to do nothing when a normal
  variable of the same name exists.  The normal variable is not removed.
  The cache entry is not created or updated and is ignored if it exists.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0076
-------

The ``target_sources()`` command converts relative paths to absolute.

In CMake 3.13 and above, the ``target_sources()`` command now converts
relative source file paths to absolute paths in the following cases:

* Source files are added to the target's ``INTERFACE_SOURCES``
  property.
* The target's ``SOURCE_DIR`` property differs from
  ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``.

A path that begins with a generator expression is always left unmodified.

This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated
to expect this behavior.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to leave
all relative source file paths unmodified.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this
policy is to convert relative paths to absolute according to above rules.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.13.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.12
=================================

CMP0075
-------

Include file check macros honor ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``.

In CMake 3.12 and above, the

* ``check_include_file`` macro in the ``CheckIncludeFile`` module, the
* ``check_include_file_cxx`` macro in the
  ``CheckIncludeFileCXX`` module, and the
* ``check_include_files`` macro in the ``CheckIncludeFiles`` module

now prefer to link the check executable to the libraries listed in the
``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` variable.  This policy provides compatibility
with projects that have not been updated to expect this behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``
in the include file check macros.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to
honor ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES`` in the include file check macros.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0074
-------

``find_package()`` uses ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables.

In CMake 3.12 and above the ``find_package(<PackageName>)`` command now
searches prefixes specified by the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` CMake
variable and the ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` environment variable.
Package roots are maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*``
commands inside find modules and config packages also search the roots as
prefixes.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been
updated to avoid using ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PackageName>_ROOT``
variables.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use
``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0073
-------

Do not produce legacy ``_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries.

Ancient CMake versions once used ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries to
propagate library link dependencies.  This has long been done by other
means, leaving the ``export_library_dependencies()`` command as the
only user of these values.  That command has long been disallowed by
policy ``CMP0033``, but the ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache entries
were left for compatibility with possible non-standard uses by projects.

CMake 3.12 and above now prefer to not produce these cache entries
at all.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have
not been updated to avoid using them.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` cache
entries.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not set them.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.12.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.
Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.11
=================================

CMP0072
-------

``FindOpenGL`` prefers GLVND by default when available.

The ``FindOpenGL`` module provides an ``OpenGL::GL`` target and an
``OPENGL_LIBRARIES`` variable for projects to use for legacy GL interfaces.
When both a legacy GL library (e.g. ``libGL.so``) and GLVND libraries
for OpenGL and GLX (e.g. ``libOpenGL.so`` and ``libGLX.so``) are available,
the module must choose between them.  It documents an ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE``
variable that can be used to specify an explicit preference.  When no such
preference is set, the module must choose a default preference.

CMake 3.11 and above prefer to choose GLVND libraries.  This policy provides
compatibility with projects that expect the legacy GL library to be used.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to set ``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` to
``LEGACY``.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set
``OpenGL_GL_PREFERENCE`` to ``GLVND``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.11.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.10
=================================

CMP0071
-------

Let ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC`` process
``GENERATED`` files.

Since version 3.10, CMake processes **regular** and ``GENERATED``
source files in ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC``.
In earlier CMake versions, only **regular** source files were processed.
``GENERATED`` source files were ignored silently.

This policy affects how source files that are ``GENERATED``
get treated in ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC``.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``GENERATED``
source files in ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC``.

The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to process ``GENERATED``
source files in ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC`` just like regular
source files.

.. note::

  To silence the ``CMP0071`` warning source files can be excluded from
  ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC`` processing by setting the
  source file properties ``SKIP_AUTOMOC``, ``SKIP_AUTOUIC`` or
  ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

Source skip example::

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE /path/to/file1.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOMOC ON)
 set_property(SOURCE /path/to/file2.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
 set_property(SOURCE /path/to/file3.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOGEN ON)
 # ...

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.10.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0070
-------

Define ``file(GENERATE)`` behavior for relative paths.

CMake 3.10 and newer define that relative paths given to ``INPUT`` and
``OUTPUT`` arguments of ``file(GENERATE)`` are interpreted relative to the
current source and binary directories, respectively.  CMake 3.9 and lower did
not define any behavior for relative paths but did not diagnose them either
and accidentally treated them relative to the process working directory.
Policy ``CMP0070`` provides compatibility with projects that used the old
undefined behavior.

This policy affects behavior of relative paths given to ``file(GENERATE)``.
The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to treat the paths relative to the
working directory of CMake.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
interpret relative paths with respect to the current source or binary
directory of the caller.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.10.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.9
================================

CMP0069
-------

``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`` is enforced when enabled.

CMake 3.9 and newer prefer to add IPO flags whenever the
``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`` target property is enabled and
produce an error if flags are not known to CMake for the current compiler.
Since a given compiler may not support IPO flags in all environments in which
it is used, it is now the project's responsibility to use the
``CheckIPOSupported`` module to check for support before enabling the
``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`` target property.  This approach
allows a project to conditionally activate IPO when supported.  It also
allows an end user to set the ``CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION``
variable in an environment known to support IPO even if the project does
not enable the property.

Since CMake 3.8 and lower only honored ``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION``
for the Intel compiler on Linux, some projects may unconditionally enable the
target property.  Policy ``CMP0069`` provides compatibility with such projects.

This policy takes effect whenever the IPO property is enabled.  The ``OLD``
behavior for this policy is to add IPO flags only for Intel compiler on Linux.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to add IPO flags for the current
compiler or produce an error if CMake does not know the flags.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.9.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Examples
^^^^^^^^

Behave like CMake 3.8 and do not apply any IPO flags except for Intel compiler
on Linux:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8)
 project(foo)

 # ...

 set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

Use the ``CheckIPOSupported`` module to detect whether IPO is
supported by the current compiler, environment, and CMake version.
Produce a fatal error if support is not available:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) # CMP0069 NEW
 project(foo)

 include(CheckIPOSupported)
 check_ipo_supported()

 # ...

 set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

Apply IPO flags only if compiler supports it:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) # CMP0069 NEW
 project(foo)

 include(CheckIPOSupported)

 # ...

 check_ipo_supported(RESULT result)
 if(result)
   set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)
 endif()

Apply IPO flags without any checks.  This may lead to build errors if IPO
is not supported by the compiler in the current environment.  Produce an
error if CMake does not know IPO flags for the current compiler:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.9) # CMP0069 NEW
 project(foo)

 # ...

 set_property(TARGET ... PROPERTY INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION TRUE)

CMP0068
-------

``RPATH`` settings on macOS do not affect ``install_name``.

CMake 3.9 and newer remove any effect the following settings may have on the
``install_name`` of a target on macOS:

* ``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` target property
* ``SKIP_BUILD_RPATH`` target property
* ``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH`` variable
* ``CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH`` variable

Previously, setting ``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` had the effect of
setting both the ``install_name`` of a target to ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR``
and the ``RPATH`` to ``INSTALL_RPATH``.  In CMake 3.9, it only affects
setting of ``RPATH``.  However, if one wants ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` to
apply to the target in the build tree, one may set
``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR``.

If ``SKIP_BUILD_RPATH``, ``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH`` or
``CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH`` were used to strip the directory portion
of the ``install_name`` of a target, one may set ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR=""``
instead.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to use the ``RPATH`` settings for
``install_name`` on macOS.  The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to ignore
the ``RPATH`` settings for ``install_name`` on macOS.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.9.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.
Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.8
================================

CMP0067
-------

Honor language standard in ``try_compile()`` source-file signature.

The ``try_compile()`` source file signature is intended to allow
callers to check whether they will be able to compile a given source file
with the current toolchain.  In order to match compiler behavior, any
language standard mode should match.  However, CMake 3.7 and below did not
do this.  CMake 3.8 and above prefer to honor the language standard settings
for ``C``, ``CXX`` (C++), and ``CUDA`` using the values of the variables:

* ``CMAKE_C_STANDARD``
* ``CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
* ``CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS``
* ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD``
* ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
* ``CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS``
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD``
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED``
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS``

This policy provides compatibility for projects that do not expect
the language standard settings to be used automatically.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to ignore language standard
setting variables when generating the ``try_compile`` test project.
The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to honor language standard
setting variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.8.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0067``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.7
================================

CMP0066
-------

Honor per-config flags in ``try_compile()`` source-file signature.

The source file signature of the ``try_compile()`` command uses the value
of the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` variable in the test project so that the
test compilation works as it would in the main project.  However, CMake 3.6 and
below do not also honor config-specific compiler flags such as those in the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG`` variable.  CMake 3.7 and above prefer to
honor config-specific compiler flags too.  This policy provides compatibility
for projects that do not expect config-specific compiler flags to be used.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to ignore config-specific flag
variables like ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG`` and only use CMake's
built-in defaults for the current compiler and platform.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to honor config-specific flag
variabldes like ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.7.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0066``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.4
================================

CMP0065
-------

Do not add flags to export symbols from executables without
the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property.

CMake 3.3 and below, for historical reasons, always linked executables
on some platforms with flags like ``-rdynamic`` to export symbols from
the executables for use by any plugins they may load via ``dlopen``.
CMake 3.4 and above prefer to do this only for executables that are
explicitly marked with the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link
flags when linking executables regardless of the value of the
``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to only use the additional link
flags when linking executables if the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target
property is set to ``True``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0064
-------

Recognize ``TEST`` as a operator for the ``if()`` command.

The ``TEST`` operator was added to the ``if()`` command to determine if a
given test name was created by the ``add_test()`` command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the ``TEST`` operator.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to interpret the ``TEST`` operator.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.3
================================

CMP0063
-------

Honor visibility properties for all target types.

The ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` and
``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` target properties affect visibility
of symbols during dynamic linking.  When first introduced these properties
affected compilation of sources only in shared libraries, module libraries,
and executables with the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` property set.  This
was sufficient for the basic use cases of shared libraries and executables
with plugins.  However, some sources may be compiled as part of static
libraries or object libraries and then linked into a shared library later.
CMake 3.3 and above prefer to honor these properties for sources compiled
in all target types.  This policy preserves compatibility for projects
expecting the properties to work only for some target types.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the visibility properties
for static libraries, object libraries, and executables without exports.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to honor the visibility properties
for all target types.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0062
-------

Disallow ``install()`` of ``export()`` result.

The ``export()`` command generates a file containing
:ref:`Imported Targets`, which is suitable for use from the build
directory.  It is not suitable for installation because it contains absolute
paths to buildsystem locations, and is particular to a single build
configuration.

The ``install(EXPORT)`` generates and installs files which contain
:ref:`Imported Targets`.  These files are generated with relative paths
(unless the user specifies absolute paths), and are designed for
multi-configuration use.  See :ref:`Creating Packages` for more.

CMake 3.3 no longer allows the use of the ``install(FILES)`` command
with the result of the ``export()`` command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow installing the result of
an ``export()`` command.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is
not to allow installing the result of an ``export()`` command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0061
-------

CTest does not by default tell ``make`` to ignore errors (``-i``).

The ``ctest_build()`` and ``build_command()`` commands no
longer generate build commands for :ref:`Makefile Generators` with
the ``-i`` option.  Previously this was done to help build as much
of tested projects as possible.  However, this behavior is not
consistent with other generators and also causes the return code
of the ``make`` tool to be meaningless.

Of course users may still add this option manually by setting
``CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND`` or the ``MAKECOMMAND`` cache entry.
See the :ref:`CTest Build Step` ``MakeCommand`` setting documentation
for their effects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to add ``-i`` to ``make``
calls in CTest.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to not
add ``-i``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn when this policy is not set and
simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0060
-------

Link libraries by full path even in implicit directories.

Policy ``CMP0003`` was introduced with the intention of always
linking library files by full path when a full path is given to the
``target_link_libraries()`` command.  However, on some platforms
(e.g. HP-UX) the compiler front-end adds alternative library search paths
for the current architecture (e.g. ``/usr/lib/<arch>`` has alternatives
to libraries in ``/usr/lib`` for the current architecture).
On such platforms the ``find_library()`` may find a library such as
``/usr/lib/libfoo.so`` that does not belong to the current architecture.

Prior to policy ``CMP0003`` projects would still build in such
cases because the incorrect library path would be converted to ``-lfoo``
on the link line and the linker would find the proper library in the
arch-specific search path provided by the compiler front-end implicitly.
At the time we chose to remain compatible with such projects by always
converting library files found in implicit link directories to ``-lfoo``
flags to ask the linker to search for them.  This approach allowed existing
projects to continue to build while still linking to libraries outside
implicit link directories via full path (such as those in the build tree).

CMake does allow projects to override this behavior by using an
:ref:`IMPORTED library target <Imported Targets>` with its
``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` property set to the desired full path to
a library file.  In fact, many :ref:`Find Modules` are learning to provide
:ref:`Imported Targets` instead of just the traditional ``Foo_LIBRARIES``
variable listing library files.  However, this makes the link line
generated for a library found by a Find Module depend on whether it
is linked through an imported target or not, which is inconsistent.
Furthermore, this behavior has been a source of confusion because the
generated link line for a library file depends on its location.  It is
also problematic for projects trying to link statically because flags
like ``-Wl,-Bstatic -lfoo -Wl,-Bdynamic`` may be used to help the linker
select ``libfoo.a`` instead of ``libfoo.so`` but then leak dynamic linking
to following libraries.  (See the ``LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC``
target property for a solution typically used for that problem.)

When the special case for libraries in implicit link directories was first
introduced the list of implicit link directories was simply hard-coded
(e.g. ``/lib``, ``/usr/lib``, and a few others).  Since that time, CMake
has learned to detect the implicit link directories used by the compiler
front-end.  If necessary, the ``find_library()`` command could be
taught to use this information to help find libraries of the proper
architecture.

For these reasons, CMake 3.3 and above prefer to drop the special case
and link libraries by full path even when they are in implicit link
directories.  Policy ``CMP0060`` provides compatibility for existing
projects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ask the linker to search for
libraries whose full paths are known to be in implicit link directories.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to link libraries by full path even
if they are in implicit link directories.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0060``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0059
-------

Do not treat ``DEFINITIONS`` as a built-in directory property.

CMake 3.3 and above no longer make a list of definitions available through
the ``DEFINITIONS`` directory property.  The
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` directory property may be used instead.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to provide the list of flags given
so far to the ``add_definitions()`` command.  The ``NEW`` behavior is
to behave as a normal user-defined directory property.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0058
-------

Ninja requires custom command byproducts to be explicit.

When an intermediate file generated during the build is consumed
by an expensive operation or a large tree of dependents, one may
reduce the work needed for an incremental rebuild by updating the
file timestamp only when its content changes.  With this approach
the generation rule must have a separate output file that is always
updated with a new timestamp that is newer than any dependencies of
the rule so that the build tool re-runs the rule only when the input
changes.  We refer to the separate output file as a rule's *witness*
and the generated file as a rule's *byproduct*.

Byproducts may not be listed as outputs because their timestamps are
allowed to be older than the inputs.  No build tools (like ``make``)
that existed when CMake was designed have a way to express byproducts.
Therefore CMake versions prior to 3.2 had no way to specify them.
Projects typically left byproducts undeclared in the rules that
generate them.  For example:

 add_custom_command(
   OUTPUT witness.txt
   COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
           byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change
   COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E touch witness.txt
   DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
   )
 add_custom_target(Provider DEPENDS witness.txt)
 add_custom_command(
   OUTPUT generated.c
   COMMAND expensive-task -i byproduct.txt -o generated.c
   DEPENDS ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/byproduct.txt
   )
 add_library(Consumer generated.c)
 add_dependencies(Consumer Provider)

This works well for all generators except ``Ninja``.
The Ninja build tool sees a rule listing ``byproduct.txt``
as a dependency and no rule listing it as an output.  Ninja then
complains that there is no way to satisfy the dependency and
stops building even though there are order-only dependencies
that ensure ``byproduct.txt`` will exist before its consumers
need it.  See discussion of this problem in Ninja Issue 760
for further details on why Ninja works this way.

Instead of leaving byproducts undeclared in the rules that generate
them, Ninja expects byproducts to be listed along with other outputs.
Such rules may be marked with a ``restat`` option that tells Ninja
to check the timestamps of outputs after the rules run.  This
prevents byproducts whose timestamps do not change from causing
their dependents to re-build unnecessarily.

Since the above approach does not tell CMake what custom command
generates ``byproduct.txt``, the Ninja generator does not have
enough information to add the byproduct as an output of any rule.
CMake 2.8.12 and above work around this problem and allow projects
using the above approach to build by generating ``phony`` build
rules to tell Ninja to tolerate such missing files.  However, this
workaround prevents Ninja from diagnosing a dependency that is
really missing.  It also works poorly in in-source builds where
every custom command dependency, even on source files, needs to
be treated this way because CMake does not have enough information
to know which files are generated as byproducts of custom commands.

CMake 3.2 introduced the ``BYPRODUCTS`` option to the
``add_custom_command()`` and ``add_custom_target()``
commands.  This option allows byproducts to be specified explicitly:

 add_custom_command(
   OUTPUT witness.txt
   BYPRODUCTS byproduct.txt # explicit byproduct specification
   COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND} -E copy_if_different
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/input.txt
           byproduct.txt # timestamp may not change
 ...

The ``BYPRODUCTS`` option is used by the ``Ninja`` generator
to list byproducts among the outputs of the custom commands that
generate them, and is ignored by other generators.

CMake 3.3 and above prefer to require projects to specify custom
command byproducts explicitly so that it can avoid using the
``phony`` rule workaround altogether.  Policy ``CMP0058`` was
introduced to provide compatibility with existing projects that
still need the workaround.

This policy has no effect on generators other than ``Ninja``.
The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to generate Ninja ``phony``
rules for unknown dependencies in the build tree.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to not generate these and instead
require projects to specify custom command ``BYPRODUCTS`` explicitly.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when it sees unknown dependencies in
out-of-source build trees if the policy is not set and then uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
the policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.  The policy setting
must be in scope at the end of the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt``
file of the project and has global effect.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0057
-------

Support new ``if()`` IN_LIST operator.

CMake 3.3 adds support for the new IN_LIST operator.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the IN_LIST operator.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to interpret the IN_LIST operator.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.3.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.2
================================

CMP0056
-------

Honor link flags in ``try_compile()`` source-file signature.

The ``try_compile()`` command source-file signature generates a
``CMakeLists.txt`` file to build the source file into an executable.
In order to compile the source the same way as it might be compiled
by the calling project, the generated project sets the value of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` variable to that in the calling project.
The value of the ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`` variable may be
needed in some cases too, but CMake 3.1 and lower did not set it in
the generated project.  CMake 3.2 and above prefer to set it so that
linker flags are honored as well as compiler flags.  This policy
provides compatibility with the pre-3.2 behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not set the value of the
``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`` variable in the generated test
project.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set the value of
the ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS`` variable in the test project
to the same as it is in the calling project.

If the project code does not set the policy explicitly, users may
set it on the command line by defining the
``CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP0056``
variable in the cache.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.2.  Unlike most policies,
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn by default when this policy
is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.  See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0056``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0055
-------

Strict checking for the ``break()`` command.

CMake 3.1 and lower allowed calls to the ``break()`` command
outside of a loop context and also ignored any given arguments.
This was undefined behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow ``break()`` to be placed
outside of loop contexts and ignores any arguments.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if a misplaced break or any arguments are found.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.2.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or
``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.1
================================

CMP0054
-------

Only interpret ``if()`` arguments as variables or keywords when unquoted.

CMake 3.1 and above no longer implicitly dereference variables or
interpret keywords in an ``if()`` command argument when
it is a :ref:`Quoted Argument` or a :ref:`Bracket Argument`.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to dereference variables and
interpret keywords even if they are quoted or bracketed.
The ``NEW`` behavior is to not dereference variables or interpret keywords
that have been quoted or bracketed.

Given the following partial example:

::

 set(A E)
 set(E "")

 if("${A}" STREQUAL "")
   message("Result is TRUE before CMake 3.1 or when CMP0054 is OLD")
 else()
   message("Result is FALSE in CMake 3.1 and above if CMP0054 is NEW")
 endif()

After explicit expansion of variables this gives:

::

 if("E" STREQUAL "")

With the policy set to ``OLD`` implicit expansion reduces this semantically to:

::

 if("" STREQUAL "")

With the policy set to ``NEW`` the quoted arguments will not be
further dereferenced:

::

 if("E" STREQUAL "")

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0053
-------

Simplify variable reference and escape sequence evaluation.

CMake 3.1 introduced a much faster implementation of evaluation of the
:ref:`Variable References` and :ref:`Escape Sequences` documented in the
``cmake-language(7)`` manual.  While the behavior is identical
to the legacy implementation in most cases, some corner cases were
cleaned up to simplify the behavior.  Specifically:

* Expansion of ``@VAR@`` reference syntax defined by the
  ``configure_file()`` and ``string(CONFIGURE)``
  commands is no longer performed in other contexts.

* Literal ``${VAR}`` reference syntax may contain only
  alphanumeric characters (``A-Z``, ``a-z``, ``0-9``) and
  the characters ``_``, ``.``, ``/``, ``-``, and ``+``.
  Note that ``$`` is technically allowed in the ``NEW`` behavior, but is
  invalid for ``OLD`` behavior.  This is due to an oversight during the
  implementation of ``CMP0053`` and its use as a literal variable
  reference is discouraged for this reason.
  Variables with other characters in their name may still
  be referenced indirectly, e.g.

  .. code-block:: cmake

    set(varname "otherwise & disallowed $ characters")
    message("${${varname}}")

* The setting of policy ``CMP0010`` is not considered,
  so improper variable reference syntax is always an error.

* More characters are allowed to be escaped in variable names.
  Previously, only ``()#" \@^`` were valid characters to
  escape. Now any non-alphanumeric, non-semicolon, non-NUL
  character may be escaped following the ``escape_identity``
  production in the :ref:`Escape Sequences` section of the
  ``cmake-language(7)`` manual.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to honor the legacy behavior for
variable references and escape sequences.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to
use the simpler variable expansion and escape sequence evaluation rules.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0052
-------

Reject source and build dirs in installed
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

CMake 3.0 and lower allowed subdirectories of the source directory or build
directory to be in the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of
installed and exported targets, if the directory was also a subdirectory of
the installation prefix.  This makes the installation depend on the
existence of the source dir or binary dir, and the installation will be
broken if either are removed after installation.

See :ref:`Include Directories and Usage Requirements` for more on
specifying include directories for targets.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to export the content of the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` with the source or binary
directory.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if such a directory is used.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0051
-------

List TARGET_OBJECTS in SOURCES target property.

CMake 3.0 and lower did not include the ``TARGET_OBJECTS``
``generator expression`` when
returning the ``SOURCES`` target property.

Configure-time CMake code is not able to handle generator expressions.  If
using the ``SOURCES`` target property at configure time, it may be
necessary to first remove generator expressions using the
``string(GENEX_STRIP)`` command.  Generate-time CMake code such as
``file(GENERATE)`` can handle the content without stripping.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to omit ``TARGET_OBJECTS``
expressions from the ``SOURCES`` target property.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to include ``TARGET_OBJECTS`` expressions
in the output.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.1.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 3.0
================================

CMP0050
-------

Disallow add_custom_command SOURCE signatures.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a signature for ``add_custom_command()``
which specified an input to a command.  This was undocumented behavior.
Modern use of CMake associates custom commands with their output, rather
than their input.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the use of
``add_custom_command()`` SOURCE signatures.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue an error if such a signature is used.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or
``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0049
-------

Do not expand variables in target source entries.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower performed an extra layer of variable expansion
when evaluating source file names::

 set(a_source foo.c)
 add_executable(foo \${a_source})

This was undocumented behavior.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to expand such variables when processing
the target sources.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue an error
if such variables need to be expanded.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0048
-------

The ``project()`` command manages ``VERSION`` variables.

CMake version 3.0 introduced the ``VERSION`` option of the ``project()``
command to specify a project version as well as the name.  In order to keep
``PROJECT_VERSION`` and related variables consistent with variable
``PROJECT_NAME`` it is necessary to set the ``VERSION`` variables
to the empty string when no ``VERSION`` is given to ``project()``.
However, this can change behavior for existing projects that set ``VERSION``
variables themselves since ``project()`` may now clear them.
This policy controls the behavior for compatibility with such projects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to leave ``VERSION`` variables untouched.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set ``VERSION`` as documented by the
``project()`` command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set
it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0047
-------

Use ``QCC`` compiler id for the qcc drivers on QNX.

CMake 3.0 and above recognize that the QNX qcc compiler driver is
different from the GNU compiler.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable to ``QCC`` instead
of ``GNU``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
QNX qcc is just ``GNU`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to
report in the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable after
language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the ``project()`` or
``enable_language()`` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use the ``GNU`` compiler id
for the qcc and QCC compiler drivers. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy
is to use the ``QCC`` compiler id for those drivers.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set this policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.  Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
by default when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0047``
variable to control the warning.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0046
-------

Error on non-existent dependency in add_dependencies.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored non-existent dependencies
listed in the ``add_dependencies()`` command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently ignore non-existent
dependencies. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error
if non-existent dependencies are listed in the ``add_dependencies()``
command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.
CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses
``OLD`` behavior.  Use the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

Error on non-existent target in get_target_property.

In CMake 2.8.12 and lower, the ``get_target_property()`` command accepted
a non-existent target argument without issuing any error or warning.  The
result variable is set to a ``-NOTFOUND`` value.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to issue no warning and set the result
variable to a ``-NOTFOUND`` value.  The ``NEW`` behavior
for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if the command is called with a
non-existent target.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

Case sensitive ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` generator expressions

CMake 2.8.12 introduced the ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID``
``generator expressions`` to allow
comparison of the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` with a test value.  The
possible valid values are lowercase, but the comparison with the test value
was performed case-insensitively.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to perform a case-insensitive comparison
with the value in the ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` expression. The ``NEW`` behavior
for this policy is to perform a case-sensitive comparison with the value in
the ``<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` expression.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

-------

Ignore COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<Config> properties

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed setting the
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` target property and
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` directory property to apply
configuration-specific compile definitions.

Since CMake 2.8.10, the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property has supported
``generator expressions`` for setting
configuration-dependent content.  The continued existence of the suffixed
variables is redundant, and causes a maintenance burden.  Population of the
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG`` property
may be replaced with a population of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` directly
or via ``target_compile_definitions()``:

 # Old Interfaces:
 set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG DEBUG_MODE
 )
 set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG DIR_DEBUG_MODE
 )

 # New Interfaces:
 set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>
 )
 target_compile_definitions(tgt PRIVATE $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DEBUG_MODE>)
 set_property(DIRECTORY APPEND PROPERTY
   COMPILE_DEFINITIONS $<$<CONFIG:Debug>:DIR_DEBUG_MODE>
 )

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to consume the content of the suffixed
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` target property when generating the
compilation command. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the content
of the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` target property .

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

-------

``MACOSX_RPATH`` is enabled by default.

CMake 2.8.12 and newer has support for using ``@rpath`` in a target's install
name.  This was enabled by setting the target property
``MACOSX_RPATH``.  The ``@rpath`` in an install name is a more
flexible and powerful mechanism than ``@executable_path`` or ``@loader_path``
for locating shared libraries.

CMake 3.0 and later prefer this property to be ON by default.  Projects
wanting ``@rpath`` in a target's install name may remove any setting of
the ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` and ``CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR``
variables.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

CMP0041
-------

Error on relative include with generator expression.

Diagnostics in CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored an entry in the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of a target if it contained a generator
expression at any position.

The path entries in that target property should not be relative. High-level
API should ensure that by adding either a source directory or a install
directory prefix, as appropriate.

As an additional diagnostic, the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` generated
on an ``IMPORTED`` target for the install location should not contain
paths in the source directory or the build directory.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore relative path entries if they
contain a generator expression. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report
an error if a generator expression appears in another location and the path is
relative.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

The target in the ``TARGET`` signature of ``add_custom_command()``
must exist and must be defined in the current directory.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower silently ignored a custom command created with
the ``TARGET`` signature of ``add_custom_command()``
if the target is unknown or was defined outside the current directory.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore custom commands
for unknown targets.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report
an error if the target referenced in ``add_custom_command()`` is
unknown or was defined outside the current directory.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.

-------

Utility targets may not have link dependencies.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed using utility targets in the left hand side
position of the ``target_link_libraries()`` command. This is an indicator
of a bug in user code.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore attempts to set the link
libraries of utility targets.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
report an error if an attempt is made to set the link libraries of a
utility target.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use

-------

Targets may not link directly to themselves.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a build target to link to itself directly with
a ``target_link_libraries()`` call. This is an indicator of a bug in
user code.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore targets which list themselves
in their own link implementation.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
report an error if a target attempts to link to itself.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use

CMP0037
-------

Target names should not be reserved and should match a validity pattern.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed creating targets using ``add_library()``,
``add_executable()`` and ``add_custom_target()`` with unrestricted
choice for the target name.  Newer cmake features such
as ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` and some
diagnostics expect target names to match a restricted pattern.

Target names may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, the underscore
character (``_``), dot(``.``), plus(``+``) and minus(``-``).
As a special case, ``ALIAS`` and ``IMPORTED`` targets may contain
two consecutive colons.

Target names reserved by one or more CMake generators are not allowed.
Among others these include ``all``, ``clean``, ``help``, and ``install``.

Target names associated with optional features, such as ``test`` and
``package``, may also be reserved.  CMake 3.10 and below always reserve them.
CMake 3.11 and above reserve them only when the corresponding feature is
enabled (e.g. by including the ``CTest`` or ``CPack`` modules).

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow creating targets with
reserved names or which do not match the validity pattern.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error
if an add_* command is used with an invalid target name.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use

The ``build_name()`` command should not be called.

This command was added in May 2001 to compute a name for the current

documented as discouraged and replaced by the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM``
and ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`` variables.

CMake >= 3.0 prefer that this command never be called.
The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the command to be called.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` when the

The ``export_library_dependencies()`` command should not be called.

This command was added in January 2003 to export ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS``
internal CMake cache entries to a file for installation with a project.
This was used at the time to allow transitive link dependencies to
work for applications outside of the original build tree of a project.
The functionality has been superseded by the ``export()`` and

The ``output_required_files()`` command should not be called.

This command was added in June 2001 to expose the then-current CMake

scanning capabilities of this command are very limited and this
functionality is better achieved through dedicated outside tools.

-------

Double colon in target name means ``ALIAS`` or ``IMPORTED`` target.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed the use of targets and files with double
colons in ``target_link_libraries()``, with some buildsystem generators.

The use of double-colons is a common pattern used to namespace ``IMPORTED``
targets and ``ALIAS`` targets.  When computing the link dependencies of
a target, the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file
on disk.  Previously, if a target was not found with a matching name, the name
was considered to refer to a file on disk.  This can lead to confusing error
messages if there is a typo in what should be a target name.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to search for targets, then files on
disk, even if the search term contains double-colons.  The ``NEW`` behavior
for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if a link dependency contains
double-colons but is not an ``IMPORTED`` target or an ``ALIAS`` target.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use

-------

Conditionally linked imported targets with missing include directories.

CMake 2.8.11 introduced introduced the concept of
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``, and a check at cmake time that the
entries in the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of an ``IMPORTED``
target actually exist.  CMake 2.8.11 also introduced generator expression
support in the ``target_link_libraries()`` command.  However, if an
imported target is linked as a result of a generator expression evaluation, the
entries in the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of that target were not
checked for existence as they should be.

The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to report a warning if an entry in
the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of a generator-expression
conditionally linked ``IMPORTED`` target does not exist.

The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to report an error if an entry in
the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of a generator-expression
conditionally linked ``IMPORTED`` target does not exist.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version

CMP0026
-------

Disallow use of the LOCATION property for build targets.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed reading the ``LOCATION`` target
property (and configuration-specific variants) to
determine the eventual location of build targets.  This relies on the
assumption that all necessary information is available at
configure-time to determine the final location and filename of the
target.  However, this property is not fully determined until later at
generate-time.  At generate time, the ``$<TARGET_FILE>`` generator
expression can be used to determine the eventual ``LOCATION`` of a target
output.

Code which reads the ``LOCATION`` target property can be ported to
use the ``$<TARGET_FILE>`` generator expression together with the
``file(GENERATE)`` subcommand to generate a file containing
the target location.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow reading the ``LOCATION``
properties from build-targets.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
not to allow reading the ``LOCATION`` properties from build-targets.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use

-------

Compiler id for Apple Clang is now ``AppleClang``.

CMake 3.0 and above recognize that Apple Clang is a different compiler
than upstream Clang and that they have different version numbers.
CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable to ``AppleClang`` instead
of ``Clang``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for
Apple Clang is just ``Clang`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0.
Therefore this policy determines for Apple Clang which compiler id to
report in the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` variable after
language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the ``project()`` or
``enable_language()`` command.  The policy must be set prior
to the invocation of either command.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``Clang``.  The
``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use compiler id ``AppleClang``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  Use the
``cmake_policy()`` command to set this policy to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.  Unlike most policies, CMake version 3.16.0-rc3 does *not* warn
by default when this policy is not set and simply uses ``OLD`` behavior.
See documentation of the
``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0025``
variable to control the warning.

CMP0024
-------

Disallow include export result.

CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed use of the ``include()`` command with the
result of the ``export()`` command.  This relies on the assumption that
the ``export()`` command has an immediate effect at configure-time during
a cmake run.  Certain properties of targets are not fully determined
until later at generate-time, such as the link language and complete
list of link libraries.  Future refactoring will change the effect of
the ``export()`` command to be executed at generate-time.  Use ``ALIAS``
targets instead in cases where the goal is to refer to targets by
another name.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow including the result of
an ``export()`` command.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is not to
allow including the result of an ``export()`` command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``

Policies Introduced by CMake 2.8
================================

CMP0023
-------

Plain and keyword ``target_link_libraries()`` signatures cannot be mixed.

CMake 2.8.12 introduced the ``target_link_libraries()`` signature using
the ``PUBLIC``, ``PRIVATE``, and ``INTERFACE`` keywords to generalize the
``LINK_PUBLIC`` and ``LINK_PRIVATE`` keywords introduced in CMake 2.8.7.
Use of signatures with any of these keywords sets the link interface of a
target explicitly, even if empty.  This produces confusing behavior
when used in combination with the historical behavior of the plain
``target_link_libraries()`` signature.  For example, consider the code:

::

 target_link_libraries(mylib A)
 target_link_libraries(mylib PRIVATE B)

After the first line the link interface has not been set explicitly so
CMake would use the link implementation, A, as the link interface.
However, the second line sets the link interface to empty.  In order
to avoid this subtle behavior CMake now prefers to disallow mixing the
plain and keyword signatures of ``target_link_libraries()`` for a single
target.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow keyword and plain
``target_link_libraries()`` signatures to be mixed.  The ``NEW`` behavior for
this policy is to not to allow mixing of the keyword and plain
signatures.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0022
-------

``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` defines the link interface.

CMake 2.8.11 constructed the 'link interface' of a target from
properties matching ``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``.
The modern way to specify config-sensitive content is to use generator
expressions and the ``IMPORTED_`` prefix makes uniform processing of the
link interface with generator expressions impossible.  The
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` target property was introduced as a
replacement in CMake 2.8.12.  This new property is named consistently
with the ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``, ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
and ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` properties.  For in-build targets, CMake
will use the INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property as the source of the
link interface only if policy ``CMP0022`` is ``NEW``.  When exporting a target
which has this policy set to ``NEW``, only the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
property will be processed and generated for the ``IMPORTED`` target by
default.  A new option to the ``install(EXPORT)`` and export commands
allows export of the old-style properties for compatibility with
downstream users of CMake versions older than 2.8.12.  The
``target_link_libraries()`` command will no longer populate the properties
matching ``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?`` if this policy is ``NEW``.

Warning-free future-compatible code which works with CMake 2.8.7 onwards
can be written by using the ``LINK_PRIVATE`` and ``LINK_PUBLIC`` keywords
of ``target_link_libraries()``.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property for in-build targets.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
property for in-build targets, and ignore the old properties matching
``(IMPORTED_)?LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES(_<CONFIG>)?``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0021
-------

Fatal error on relative paths in ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target
property.

CMake 2.8.10.2 and lower allowed the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target
property to contain relative paths.  The base path for such relative
entries is not well defined.  CMake 2.8.12 issues a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if the
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` property contains a relative path.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is not to warn about relative paths
in the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this
policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` contains a
relative path.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.12.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

CMP0020
-------

Automatically link Qt executables to ``qtmain`` target on Windows.

CMake 2.8.10 and lower required users of Qt to always specify a link
dependency to the ``qtmain.lib`` static library manually on Windows.
CMake 2.8.11 gained the ability to evaluate generator expressions
while determining the link dependencies from ``IMPORTED`` targets.  This
allows CMake itself to automatically link executables which link to Qt
to the ``qtmain.lib`` library when using ``IMPORTED`` Qt targets.  For
applications already linking to ``qtmain.lib``, this should have little
impact.  For applications which supply their own alternative WinMain
implementation and for applications which use the QAxServer library,
this automatic linking will need to be disabled as per the

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is not to link executables to
``qtmain.lib`` automatically when they link to the QtCore ``IMPORTED`` target.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to link executables to ``qtmain.lib``
automatically when they link to QtCore ``IMPORTED`` target.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0019
-------

Do not re-expand variables in include and link information.

CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the
include_directories, link_directories, and link_libraries commands to
expand any leftover variable references at the end of the
configuration step.  This was for strict compatibility with VERY early
CMake versions because all variable references are now normally
evaluated during CMake language processing.  CMake 2.8.11 and higher
prefer to skip the extra evaluation.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to re-evaluate the values for
strict compatibility.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to leave
the values untouched.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.11.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0018
-------

Ignore ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` variable.

CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` libraries
using the value of the undocumented ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS``
platform variable.  The variable contained platform-specific flags
needed to compile objects for shared libraries.  Typically it included
a flag such as ``-fPIC`` for position independent code but also included
other flags needed on certain platforms.  CMake 2.8.9 and higher
prefer instead to use the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target
property to determine what targets should be position independent, and new
undocumented platform variables to select flags while ignoring
``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` completely.

The default for either approach produces identical compilation flags,
but if a project modifies ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` from its
original value this policy determines which approach to use.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore the
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property for all targets and use the
modified value of ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` for ``SHARED`` and
``MODULE`` libraries.

The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to ignore
``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` whether it is modified or not and
honor the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` target property.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.9.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW``
explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0017
-------

Prefer files from the CMake module directory when including from there.

Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped with CMake (i.e.
located in the CMake module directory) calls ``include()`` or
``find_package()``, the files located in the CMake module directory are
preferred over the files in ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``.  This makes sure
that the modules belonging to CMake always get those files included which
they expect, and against which they were developed and tested.  In all
other cases, the files found in ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` still take
precedence over the ones in the CMake module directory.  The ``OLD``
behavior is to always prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files
from the CMake modules directory.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.4.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0016
-------

``target_link_libraries()`` reports error if its only argument
is not a target.

In CMake 2.8.2 and lower the ``target_link_libraries()`` command silently
ignored if it was called with only one argument, and this argument
wasn't a valid target.  In CMake 2.8.3 and above it reports an error
in this case.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.3.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0015
-------

 ``link_directories()`` treats paths relative to the source dir.

In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the ``link_directories()`` command passed
relative paths unchanged to the linker.  In CMake 2.8.1 and above the
``link_directories()`` command prefers to interpret relative paths with
respect to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``, which is consistent with
``include_directories()`` and other commands.  The ``OLD`` behavior for
this policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command.  The
``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to absolute
paths by appending the relative path to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.1.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0014
-------

Input directories must have ``CMakeLists.txt``.

CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing ``CMakeLists.txt``
files in directories referenced by ``add_subdirectory()`` or  ``subdirs()``,
treating them as if present but empty.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this
``cmake_policy()`` determines whether or not the case is an error.
The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently ignore the problem.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0013
-------

Duplicate binary directories are not allowed.

CMake 2.6.3 and below silently permitted add_subdirectory() calls to
create the same binary directory multiple times.  During build system
generation files would be written and then overwritten in the build
tree and could lead to strange behavior.  CMake 2.6.4 and above
explicitly detect duplicate binary directories.  CMake 2.6.4 always
considers this case an error.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy
determines whether or not the case is an error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for
this policy is to allow duplicate binary directories.  The NEW
behavior for this policy is to disallow duplicate binary directories
with an error.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0012
-------

``if()`` recognizes numbers and boolean constants.

In CMake versions 2.6.4 and lower the ``if()`` command implicitly
dereferenced arguments corresponding to variables, even those named
like numbers or boolean constants, except for ``0`` and ``1``.  Numbers and
boolean constants such as ``true``, ``false``, ``yes``, ``no``, ``on``,
``off``, ``y``, ``n``, ``notfound``, ``ignore`` (all case insensitive)
were recognized in some cases but not all.  For example, the code ``if(TRUE)``
might have evaluated as ``false``.
Numbers such as 2 were recognized only in boolean expressions
like ``if(NOT 2)`` (leading to ``false``) but not as a single-argument like
``if(2)`` (also leading to ``false``).  Later versions of CMake prefer to
treat numbers and boolean constants literally, so they should not be
used as variable names.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to implicitly dereference
variables named like numbers and boolean constants.  The ``NEW`` behavior
for this policy is to recognize numbers and boolean constants without
dereferencing variables with such names.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.8.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::

  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

Policies Introduced by CMake 2.6
================================

CMP0011
-------

Included scripts do automatic ``cmake_policy()`` PUSH and POP.

In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by
the ``include()`` and ``find_package()`` commands would affect
the includer.  Explicit invocations of ``cmake_policy(PUSH)`` and
``cmake_policy(POP)`` were required to isolate policy changes and protect
the includer.  While some scripts intend to affect the policies of their
includer, most do not.  In CMake 2.6.3 and above, ``include()`` and
``find_package()`` by default ``PUSH`` and ``POP`` an entry on
the policy stack around an included
script, but provide a ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option to disable it.  This
policy determines whether or not to imply ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` for
compatibility.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to imply
``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` for ``include()`` and ``find_package()`` commands.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to allow the commands to do
their default cmake_policy ``PUSH`` and ``POP``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0010
-------

Bad variable reference syntax is an error.

In CMake 2.6.2 and below, incorrect variable reference syntax such as
a missing close-brace (``${FOO``) was reported but did not stop
processing of CMake code.  This policy determines whether a bad
variable reference is an error.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is
to warn about the error, leave the string untouched, and continue.
The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error.

If ``CMP0053`` is set to ``NEW``, this policy has no effect
and is treated as always being ``NEW``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.3.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0009
-------

FILE GLOB_RECURSE calls should not follow symlinks by default.

In CMake 2.6.1 and below, ``file(GLOB_RECURSE)`` calls would follow
through symlinks, sometimes coming up with unexpectedly large result sets
because of symlinks to top level directories that contain hundreds of
thousands of files.

This policy determines whether or not to follow symlinks encountered
during a ``file(GLOB_RECURSE)`` call.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this
policy is to follow the symlinks.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is not
to follow the symlinks by default, but only if ``FOLLOW_SYMLINKS`` is given
as an additional argument to the ``FILE`` command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.2.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0008
-------

Libraries linked by full-path must have a valid library file name.

In CMake 2.4 and below it is possible to write code like

::

 target_link_libraries(myexe /full/path/to/somelib)

where ``somelib`` is supposed to be a valid library file name such as
``libsomelib.a`` or ``somelib.lib``.  For Makefile generators this
produces an error at build time because the dependency on the full
path cannot be found.  For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` IDE
and ``Xcode`` generators this used to
work by accident because CMake would always split off the library
directory and ask the linker to search for the library by name
(``-lsomelib`` or ``somelib.lib``).  Despite the failure with Makefiles, some
projects have code like this and build only with Visual Studio and/or Xcode.
This version of CMake prefers to pass the full path directly to the
native build tool, which will fail in this case because it does not
name a valid library file.

This policy determines what to do with full paths that do not appear
to name a valid library file.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to
split the library name from the path and ask the linker to search for
it.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to trust the given path and
pass it directly to the native build tool unchanged.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.1.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0007
-------

list command no longer ignores empty elements.

This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty
elements in the list.  CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all
empty elements in the list.  For example, ``a;b;;c`` would have length 3
and not 4.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list
elements.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to correctly count
empty elements in a list.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0006
-------

Installing ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` targets requires a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION``.

This policy determines whether the ``install(TARGETS)`` command must be
given a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION`` when asked to install a target with the
``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish
application bundles from normal executables when installing targets.
CMake 2.6 provides a ``BUNDLE`` option to the ``install(TARGETS)``
command that specifies rules specific to application bundles on the Mac.
Projects should use this option when installing a target with the
``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property set.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to fall back to the
``RUNTIME DESTINATION`` if a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION`` is not given.  The ``NEW``
behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is installed
without a ``BUNDLE DESTINATION``.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0005
-------

Preprocessor definition values are now escaped automatically.

This policy determines whether or not CMake should generate escaped
preprocessor definition values added via add_definitions.  CMake
versions 2.4 and below assumed that only trivial values would be given
for macros in add_definitions calls.  It did not attempt to escape
non-trivial values such as string literals in generated build rules.
CMake versions 2.6 and above support escaping of most values, but
cannot assume the user has not added escapes already in an attempt to
work around limitations in earlier versions.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to place definition values given
to add_definitions directly in the generated build rules without
attempting to escape anything.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to
generate correct escapes for all native build tools automatically.
See documentation of the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` target property for
limitations of the escaping implementation.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0004
-------

Libraries linked may not have leading or trailing whitespace.

CMake versions 2.4 and below silently removed leading and trailing
whitespace from libraries linked with code like

::

 target_link_libraries(myexe " A ")

This could lead to subtle errors in user projects.

The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently remove leading and
trailing whitespace.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to diagnose
the existence of such whitespace as an error.  The setting for this
policy used when checking the library names is that in effect when the
target is created by an ``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()``
command.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0003
-------

Libraries linked via full path no longer produce linker search paths.

This policy affects how libraries whose full paths are NOT known are
found at link time, but was created due to a change in how CMake deals
with libraries whose full paths are known.  Consider the code

::

 target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so)

CMake 2.4 and below implemented linking to libraries whose full paths
are known by splitting them on the link line into separate components
consisting of the linker search path and the library name.  The
example code might have produced something like

::

 ... -L/path/to -lA ...

in order to link to library A.  An analysis was performed to order
multiple link directories such that the linker would find library A in
the desired location, but there are cases in which this does not work.
CMake versions 2.6 and above use the more reliable approach of passing
the full path to libraries directly to the linker in most cases.  The
example code now produces something like

::

 ... /path/to/libA.so ....

Unfortunately this change can break code like

::

 target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

where ``B`` is meant to find ``/path/to/libB.so``.  This code is wrong
because the user is asking the linker to find library B but has not
provided a linker search path (which may be added with the
link_directories command).  However, with the old linking
implementation the code would work accidentally because the linker
search path added for library A allowed library B to be found.

In order to support projects depending on linker search paths added by
linking to libraries with known full paths, the ``OLD`` behavior for this
policy will add the linker search paths even though they are not
needed for their own libraries.  When this policy is set to ``OLD``, CMake
will produce a link line such as

::

 ... -L/path/to /path/to/libA.so -lB ...

which will allow library B to be found as it was previously.  When
this policy is set to NEW, CMake will produce a link line such as

::

 ... /path/to/libA.so -lB ...

which more accurately matches what the project specified.

The setting for this policy used when generating the link line is that
in effect when the target is created by an add_executable or
add_library command.  For the example described above, the code

::

 cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 OLD) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.4)
 add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
 target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

will work and suppress the warning for this policy.  It may also be
updated to work with the corrected linking approach:

::

 cmake_policy(SET CMP0003 NEW) # or cmake_policy(VERSION 2.6)
 link_directories(/path/to) # needed to find library B
 add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
 target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so B)

Even better, library B may be specified with a full path:

::

 add_executable(myexe myexe.c)
 target_link_libraries(myexe /path/to/libA.so /path/to/libB.so)

When all items on the link line have known paths CMake does not check
this policy so it has no effect.

Note that the warning for this policy will be issued for at most one
target.  This avoids flooding users with messages for every target
when setting the policy once will probably fix all targets.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0002
-------

Logical target names must be globally unique.

Targets names created with ``add_executable()``, ``add_library()``, or
``add_custom_target()`` are logical build target names.  Logical target
names must be globally unique because:

::

 - Unique names may be referenced unambiguously both in CMake
   code and on make tool command lines.
 - Logical names are used by Xcode and VS IDE generators
   to produce meaningful project names for the targets.

The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to
correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the
``OUTPUT_NAME`` target property to create two targets with the same
physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets
must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global
property ``ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS`` with a Makefiles generator).

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0001
-------

``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` should no longer be used.

The behavior is to check ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` and present
it to the user.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to ignore
CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY completely.

In CMake 2.4 and below the variable ``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` was
used to request compatibility with earlier versions of CMake.  In
CMake 2.6 and above all compatibility issues are handled by policies
and the ``cmake_policy()`` command.  However, CMake must still check
``CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY`` for projects written for CMake 2.4 and
below.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version
3.16.0-rc3 warns when the policy is not set and uses ``OLD`` behavior.  Use
the ``cmake_policy()`` command to set it to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` explicitly.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

CMP0000
-------

A minimum required CMake version must be specified.

CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which
they have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users
trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their
CMake.  Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake
versions newer than that specified.  Use the ``cmake_minimum_required()``
command at the top of your main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file:

::

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION <major>.<minor>)

where ``<major>.<minor>`` is the version of CMake you want to support
(such as ``3.14``).  The command will ensure that at least the given
version of CMake is running and help newer versions be compatible with
the project.  See documentation of ``cmake_minimum_required()`` for
details.

Note that the command invocation must appear in the ``CMakeLists.txt``
file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However,
the  ``cmake_policy()`` command may be called to set policy ``CMP0000``
to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior explicitly.  The ``OLD`` behavior is to
silently ignore the missing invocation.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to issue
an error instead of a warning.  An included file may set ``CMP0000``
explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the main
``CMakeLists.txt`` file.

This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.

.. note::
  The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is
  ``deprecated by definition``
  and may be removed in a future version of CMake.

cmake-properties(7)
*******************

Properties of Global Scope
==========================

ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS
------------------------------

Allow duplicate custom targets to be created.

Normally CMake requires that all targets built in a project have
globally unique logical names (see policy ``CMP0002``).
This is necessary to generate meaningful project file names in
``Xcode`` and :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` IDE
generators.  It also allows the target names to be referenced
unambiguously.

Makefile generators are capable of supporting duplicate ``add_custom_target()``
names.  For projects that care only about :ref:`Makefile Generators` and do
not wish to support ``Xcode`` or :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` IDE
generators, one may set this property to ``True``
to allow duplicate custom targets.  The property
allows multiple ``add_custom_target()`` command calls in different
directories to specify the same target name.  However, setting this
property will cause non-Makefile generators to produce an error and
refuse to generate the project.

AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP
--------------------

Name of the  ``source_group()`` for ``AUTOMOC`` and
``AUTORCC`` generated files.

Files generated by ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTORCC`` are not always
known at configure time and therefore can't be passed to
``source_group()``.
``AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP`` an be used instead to generate or select
a source group for ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTORCC`` generated files.

For ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTORCC`` specific overrides see
``AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP`` and ``AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP``
respectively.

AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER
----------------------

Name of ``FOLDER`` for ``*_autogen`` targets that are added
automatically by CMake for targets for which ``AUTOMOC`` is enabled.

If not set, CMake uses the ``FOLDER`` property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
``FOLDER`` target property and the ``AUTOMOC`` target property.

AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP
--------------------

Name of the  ``source_group()`` for ``AUTOMOC`` generated files.

When set this is used instead of ``AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP`` for
files generated by ``AUTOMOC``.

AUTOMOC_TARGETS_FOLDER
----------------------

Name of ``FOLDER`` for ``*_autogen`` targets that are added automatically by
CMake for targets for which ``AUTOMOC`` is enabled.

This property is obsolete.  Use ``AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER`` instead.

If not set, CMake uses the ``FOLDER`` property of the parent target as a
default value for this property.  See also the documentation for the
``FOLDER`` target property and the ``AUTOMOC`` target property.

AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP
--------------------

Name of the  ``source_group()`` for ``AUTORCC`` generated files.

When set this is used instead of ``AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP`` for
files generated by ``AUTORCC``.

CMAKE_C_KNOWN_FEATURES
----------------------

List of C features known to this version of CMake.

The features listed in this global property may be known to be available to the
C compiler.  If the feature is available with the C compiler, it will
be listed in the ``CMAKE_C_COMPILE_FEATURES`` variable.

The features listed here may be used with the ``target_compile_features()``
command.  See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

The features known to this version of CMake are:

``c_std_90``
  Compiler mode is aware of C 90.

``c_std_99``

CMAKE_CXX_KNOWN_FEATURES
------------------------

List of C++ features known to this version of CMake.

The features listed in this global property may be known to be available to the
C++ compiler.  If the feature is available with the C++ compiler, it will
be listed in the ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES`` variable.

The features listed here may be used with the ``target_compile_features()``
command.  See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

  Template template parameters, as defined in ``ISO/IEC 14882:1998``.

CMAKE_ROLE
----------

Tells what mode the current running script is in. Could be one of several
values:

``PROJECT``
  Running in project mode (processing a ``CMakeLists.txt`` file).

``SCRIPT``
  Running in ``-P`` script mode.

``FIND_PACKAGE``
  Running in ``--find-package`` mode.

``CTEST``
  Running in CTest script mode.

``CPACK``
  Running in CPack.

DEBUG_CONFIGURATIONS
--------------------

Specify which configurations are for debugging.

The value must be a semi-colon separated list of configuration names.
Currently this property is used only by the ``target_link_libraries()``
command.  Additional uses may be defined in the future.

This property must be set at the top level of the project and before
the first ``target_link_libraries()`` command invocation.  If any entry in
the list does not match a valid configuration for the project the
behavior is undefined.

DISABLED_FEATURES
-----------------

List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.

List of features which are disabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were not found.  This is
determined using the ``<NAME>_FOUND`` variables.  Packages which are
searched ``QUIET`` are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
this list.  This property is used by the macros in
``FeatureSummary.cmake``.

ENABLED_FEATURES
----------------

List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.

List of features which are enabled during the CMake run.  By default
it contains the names of all packages which were found.  This is
determined using the ``<NAME>_FOUND`` variables.  Packages which are
searched ``QUIET`` are not listed.  A project can add its own features to
this list.  This property is used by the macros in
``FeatureSummary.cmake``.

ENABLED_LANGUAGES
-----------------

Read-only property that contains the list of currently enabled languages

Set to list of currently enabled languages.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS
----------------------------

Whether the ``find_library()`` command should automatically search
``lib32`` directories.

``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS`` is a boolean specifying whether the
``find_library()`` command should automatically search the ``lib32``
variant of directories called ``lib`` in the search path when building 32-bit
binaries.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX`` variable.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS
----------------------------

Whether ``find_library()`` should automatically search lib64
directories.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS is a boolean specifying whether the
``find_library()`` command should automatically search the lib64
variant of directories called lib in the search path when building
64-bit binaries.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX`` variable.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS
-----------------------------

Whether the ``find_library()`` command should automatically search
``libx32`` directories.

``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS`` is a boolean specifying whether the
``find_library()`` command should automatically search the ``libx32``
variant of directories called ``lib`` in the search path when building
x32-abi binaries.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX`` variable.

FIND_LIBRARY_USE_OPENBSD_VERSIONING
-----------------------------------

Whether ``find_library()`` should find OpenBSD-style shared
libraries.

This property is a boolean specifying whether the
``find_library()`` command should find shared libraries with
OpenBSD-style versioned extension: ".so.<major>.<minor>".  The
property is set to true on OpenBSD and false on other platforms.

GENERATOR_IS_MULTI_CONFIG
-------------------------

Read-only property that is true on multi-configuration generators.

True when using a multi-configuration generator
(such as :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` or ``Xcode``).
Multi-config generators use ``CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES``
as the set of configurations and ignore ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE``.

GLOBAL_DEPENDS_DEBUG_MODE
-------------------------

Enable global target dependency graph debug mode.

CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  This property
causes it to display details of its analysis to stderr.

GLOBAL_DEPENDS_NO_CYCLES
------------------------

Disallow global target dependency graph cycles.

CMake automatically analyzes the global inter-target dependency graph
at the beginning of native build system generation.  It reports an
error if the dependency graph contains a cycle that does not consist
of all STATIC library targets.  This property tells CMake to disallow
all cycles completely, even among static libraries.

IN_TRY_COMPILE
--------------

Read-only property that is true during a try-compile configuration.

True when building a project inside a ``try_compile()`` or
``try_run()`` command.

PACKAGES_FOUND
--------------

List of packages which were found during the CMake run.

List of packages which were found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

PACKAGES_NOT_FOUND
------------------

List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.

List of packages which were not found during the CMake run.  Whether a
package has been found is determined using the <NAME>_FOUND variables.

JOB_POOLS
---------

Ninja only: List of available pools.

A pool is a named integer property and defines the maximum number
of concurrent jobs which can be started by a rule assigned to the pool.
The ``JOB_POOLS`` property is a semicolon-separated list of
pairs using the syntax NAME=integer (without a space after the equality sign).

For instance:

 set_property(GLOBAL PROPERTY JOB_POOLS two_jobs=2 ten_jobs=10)

Defined pools could be used globally by setting
``CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE`` and ``CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK``
or per target by setting the target properties
``JOB_POOL_COMPILE`` and ``JOB_POOL_LINK``.
``Custom commands`` and
``custom targets`` can specify pools using the
option ``JOB_POOL``.
Using a pool that is not defined by ``JOB_POOLS`` causes
an error by ninja at build time.

If not set, this property uses the value of the ``CMAKE_JOB_POOLS``
variable.

Build targets provided by CMake that are meant for individual interactive
use, such as ``install``, are placed in the ``console`` pool automatically.

PREDEFINED_TARGETS_FOLDER
-------------------------

Name of FOLDER for targets that are added automatically by CMake.

If not set, CMake uses "CMakePredefinedTargets" as a default value for
this property.  Targets such as INSTALL, PACKAGE and RUN_TESTS will be
organized into this FOLDER.  See also the documentation for the
``FOLDER`` target property.

ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES
---------------------

List of natures to add to the generated Eclipse project file.

Eclipse projects specify language plugins by using natures. This property
should be set to the unique identifier for a nature (which looks like a Java
package name).

Also see the ``ECLIPSE_EXTRA_CPROJECT_CONTENTS`` property.

ECLIPSE_EXTRA_CPROJECT_CONTENTS
-------------------------------

Additional contents to be inserted into the generated Eclipse cproject file.

The cproject file defines the CDT specific information. Some third party IDE's
are based on Eclipse with the addition of other information specific to that IDE.
Through this property, it is possible to add this additional contents to
the generated project.
It is expected to contain valid XML.

Also see the ``ECLIPSE_EXTRA_NATURES`` property.

REPORT_UNDEFINED_PROPERTIES
---------------------------

If set, report any undefined properties to this file.

If this property is set to a filename then when CMake runs it will
report any properties or variables that were accessed but not defined
into the filename specified in this property.

RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
-------------------

Specify a launcher for compile rules.

:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the ``Ninja`` generator prefix
compiler commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.

RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
------------------

Specify a launcher for custom rules.

:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the ``Ninja`` generator prefix
custom commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.

RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
----------------

Specify a launcher for link rules.

:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the ``Ninja`` generator prefix
link and archive commands with the given launcher command line.
This is intended to allow launchers to intercept build problems
with high granularity.  Other generators ignore this property
because their underlying build systems provide no hook to wrap
individual commands with a launcher.

RULE_MESSAGES
-------------

Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

This property specifies whether Makefile generators should add a
progress message describing what each build rule does.  If the
property is not set the default is ON.  Set the property to OFF to
disable granular messages and report only as each target completes.
This is intended to allow scripted builds to avoid the build time cost
of detailed reports.  If a ``CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES`` cache entry exists
its value initializes the value of this property.  Non-Makefile
generators currently ignore this property.

TARGET_ARCHIVES_MAY_BE_SHARED_LIBS
----------------------------------

Set if shared libraries may be named like archives.

On AIX shared libraries may be named "lib<name>.a".  This property is
set to true on such platforms.

TARGET_MESSAGES
---------------

Specify whether to report the completion of each target.

This property specifies whether :ref:`Makefile Generators` should
add a progress message describing that each target has been completed.
If the property is not set the default is ``ON``.  Set the property
to ``OFF`` to disable target completion messages.

This option is intended to reduce build output when little or no
work needs to be done to bring the build tree up to date.

If a ``CMAKE_TARGET_MESSAGES`` cache entry exists its value
initializes the value of this property.

Non-Makefile generators currently ignore this property.

See the counterpart property ``RULE_MESSAGES`` to disable
everything except for target completion messages.

TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS
---------------------------

Does the target platform support shared libraries.

TARGET_SUPPORTS_SHARED_LIBS is a boolean specifying whether the target
platform supports shared libraries.  Basically all current general
general purpose OS do so, the exception are usually embedded systems
with no or special OSs.

USE_FOLDERS
-----------

Use the ``FOLDER`` target property to organize targets into
folders.

If not set, CMake treats this property as ``OFF`` by default.  CMake
generators that are capable of organizing into a hierarchy of folders
use the values of the ``FOLDER`` target property to name those
folders. See also the documentation for the ``FOLDER`` target property.

XCODE_EMIT_EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME
----------------------------------

Control emission of ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` by the ``Xcode``
generator.

It is required for building the same target with multiple SDKs. A
common use case is the parallel use of ``iphoneos`` and
``iphonesimulator`` SDKs.

Three different states possible that control when the ``Xcode``
generator emits the ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable:

- If set to ``ON`` it will always be emitted
- If set to ``OFF`` it will never be emitted
- If unset (the default) it will only be emitted when the project was
  configured for an embedded Xcode SDK like iOS, tvOS, watchOS or any
  of the simulators.

.. note::

  When this behavior is enable for generated Xcode projects, the
  ``EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable will leak into
  ``Generator expressions``
  like ``TARGET_FILE`` and will render those mostly unusable.

Properties on Directories
=========================

ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES
----------------------

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of files or directories that will be
removed as a part of the global ``clean`` target.  It is useful for
specifying generated files or directories that are used by multiple targets
or by CMake itself, or that are generated in ways which cannot be captured as
outputs or byproducts of custom commands.

If an additional clean file is specific to a single target only, then the
``ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`` target property would usually be a better
choice than this directory property.

Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the
current binary directory.

Contents of ``ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`` may use
``generator expressions``.

This property only works for the ``Ninja`` and the Makefile
generators.  It is ignored by other generators.

BINARY_DIR
----------

This read-only directory property reports absolute path to the binary
directory corresponding to the source on which it is read.

BUILDSYSTEM_TARGETS
-------------------

This read-only directory property contains a
:ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of buildsystem targets added in the
directory by calls to the ``add_library()``, ``add_executable()``,
and ``add_custom_target()`` commands.  The list does not include any
:ref:`Imported Targets` or :ref:`Alias Targets`, but does include
:ref:`Interface Libraries`.  Each entry in the list is the logical name
of a target, suitable to pass to the ``get_property()`` command
``TARGET`` option.

CACHE_VARIABLES
---------------

List of cache variables available in the current directory.

This read-only property specifies the list of CMake cache variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

CLEAN_NO_CUSTOM
---------------

Set to true to tell :ref:`Makefile Generators` not to remove the outputs of
custom commands for this directory during the ``make clean`` operation.
This is ignored on other generators because it is not possible to implement.

CMAKE_CONFIGURE_DEPENDS
-----------------------

Tell CMake about additional input files to the configuration process.
If any named file is modified the build system will re-run CMake to
re-configure the file and generate the build system again.

Specify files as a semicolon-separated list of paths.  Relative paths
are interpreted as relative to the current source directory.

COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-------------------

Preprocessor definitions for compiling a directory's sources.

This property specifies the list of options given so far to the
``add_compile_definitions()`` (or ``add_definitions()``) command.

The ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property may be set to a semicolon-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).

This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in the
directory's parent.

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.

Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include::

 #          - broken almost everywhere
 ;          - broken in VS IDE 7.0 and Borland Makefiles
 ,          - broken in VS IDE
 %          - broken in some cases in NMake
 & |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
 ^ < > \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
some cases.  Use with caution.

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The corresponding ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` property may
be set to specify per-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.

COMPILE_OPTIONS
---------------

List of options to pass to the compiler.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
given so far to the ``add_compile_options()`` command.

This property is used to initialize the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.

Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

DEFINITIONS
-----------

For CMake 2.4 compatibility only.  Use ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
instead.

This read-only property specifies the list of flags given so far to
the ``add_definitions()`` command.  It is intended for debugging
purposes.  Use the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` directory property
instead.

This built-in read-only property does not exist if policy
``CMP0059`` is set to ``NEW``.

EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
----------------

Set this directory property to a true value on a subdirectory to exclude
its targets from the "all" target of its ancestors.  If excluded, running
e.g. ``make`` in the parent directory will not build targets the
subdirectory by default.  This does not affect the "all" target of the
subdirectory itself.  Running e.g. ``make`` inside the subdirectory will
still build its targets.

If the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` target property is set on a target
then its value determines whether the target is included in the "all"
target of this directory and its ancestors.

IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
----------------------------------

Specify ``#include`` line transforms for dependencies in a directory.

This property specifies rules to transform macro-like ``#include`` lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
``A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%`` (the ``%`` must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of ``A_MACRO(...)`` on ``#include`` lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
``%``.  For example, the entry

::

 MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>

will convert lines of the form

::

 #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

to

::

 #include <mydir/myheader.h>

allowing the dependency to be followed.

This property applies to sources in all targets within a directory.
The property value is initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory's parent.

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------

List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
``include_directories()`` command.

This property is used to populate the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
target property, which is used by the generators to set the include
directories for the compiler.

In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set
directly on any directory using the ``set_property()`` command, and can be
set on the current directory using the ``set_directory_properties()``
command.  A directory gets its initial value from its parent directory if it has
one.  The initial value of the ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property
comes from the value of this property.  Both directory and target property
values are adjusted by calls to the ``include_directories()`` command.
Calls to ``set_property()`` or ``set_directory_properties()``,
however, will update the directory property value without updating target
property values.  Therefore direct property updates must be made before
calls to ``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` for targets
they are meant to affect.

The target property values are used by the generators to set the
include paths for the compiler.

Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INCLUDE_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
--------------------------

Include file scanning regular expression.

This property specifies the regular expression used during
dependency scanning to match include files that should be followed.
See the ``include_regular_expression()`` command for a high-level
interface to set this property.

INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------

Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a directory.

This is a per-configuration version of ``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION``.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.

INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------

Enable interprocedural optimization for targets in a directory.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known to be supported by the compiler.

LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a directory and all of its
subdirectories. This is equivalent to setting the ``LABELS`` target
property and the ``LABELS`` test property on all targets and tests in
the current directory and subdirectories. Note: Launchers must enabled to
propagate labels to targets.

The ``CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS`` variable can be used to initialize this
property.

The list is reported in dashboard submissions.

LINK_DIRECTORIES
----------------

List of linker search directories.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories
and is typically populated using the ``link_directories()`` command.
It gets its initial value from its parent directory, if it has one.

The directory property is used to initialize the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``
target property when a target is created.  That target property is used
by the generators to set the library search directories for the linker.

Contents of ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

LINK_OPTIONS
------------

List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module
and executable targets.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
given so far to the ``add_link_options()`` command.

This property is used to initialize the ``LINK_OPTIONS`` target
property when a target is created, which is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.

Contents of ``LINK_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

LISTFILE_STACK
--------------

The current stack of listfiles being processed.

This property is mainly useful when trying to debug errors in your
CMake scripts.  It returns a list of what list files are currently
being processed, in order.  So if one listfile does an
``include()`` command then that is effectively pushing the
included listfile onto the stack.

MACROS
------

List of macro commands available in the current directory.

This read-only property specifies the list of CMake macros currently
defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.  See the ``macro()``
command.

PARENT_DIRECTORY
----------------

Source directory that added current subdirectory.

This read-only property specifies the source directory that added the
current source directory as a subdirectory of the build.  In the
top-level directory the value is the empty-string.

RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
-------------------

Specify a launcher for compile rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.

RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
------------------

Specify a launcher for custom rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.

RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
----------------

Specify a launcher for link rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global property for a directory.

SOURCE_DIR
----------

This read-only directory property reports absolute path to the source
directory on which it is read.

SUBDIRECTORIES
--------------

This read-only directory property contains a
:ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of subdirectories processed so far by
the ``add_subdirectory()`` or ``subdirs()`` commands.  Each entry is
the absolute path to the source directory (containing the ``CMakeLists.txt``
file).  This is suitable to pass to the ``get_property()`` command
``DIRECTORY`` option.

.. note::

  The ``subdirs()`` command does not process its arguments until
  after the calling directory is fully processed.  Therefore looking
  up this property in the current directory will not see them.

TESTS
-----

List of tests.

This read-only property holds a
:ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of tests
defined so far, in the current directory, by the ``add_test()`` command.

TEST_INCLUDE_FILES
------------------

A list of cmake files that will be included when ctest is run.

If you specify ``TEST_INCLUDE_FILES``, those files will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.

VARIABLES
---------

List of variables defined in the current directory.

This read-only property specifies the list of CMake variables
currently defined.  It is intended for debugging purposes.

VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_<section>
--------------------------------

Specify a postSolution global section in Visual Studio.

Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:

::

 GlobalSection(<section>) = postSolution
   <contents based on property value>
 EndGlobalSection

The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of ``key=value``
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` contains a ``project()`` command.

Note that CMake generates postSolution sections ``ExtensibilityGlobals``
and ``ExtensibilityAddIns`` by default.  If you set the corresponding
property, it will override the default section.  For example, setting
``VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_POST_ExtensibilityGlobals`` will override the default
contents of the ``ExtensibilityGlobals`` section, while keeping
ExtensibilityAddIns on its default.  However, CMake will always
add a ``SolutionGuid`` to the ``ExtensibilityGlobals`` section
if it is not specified explicitly.

VS_GLOBAL_SECTION_PRE_<section>
-------------------------------

Specify a preSolution global section in Visual Studio.

Setting a property like this generates an entry of the following form
in the solution file:

::

 GlobalSection(<section>) = preSolution
   <contents based on property value>
 EndGlobalSection

The property must be set to a semicolon-separated list of ``key=value``
pairs.  Each such pair will be transformed into an entry in the
solution global section.  Whitespace around key and value is ignored.
List elements which do not contain an equal sign are skipped.

This property only works for Visual Studio 9 and above; it is ignored
on other generators.  The property only applies when set on a
directory whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` contains a ``project()`` command.

VS_STARTUP_PROJECT
------------------

Specify the default startup project in a Visual Studio solution.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` create a ``.sln`` file for each directory
whose ``CMakeLists.txt`` file calls the ``project()`` command.  Set this
property in the same directory as a ``project()`` command call (e.g. in
the top-level ``CMakeLists.txt`` file) to specify the default startup project
for the corresponding solution file.

The property must be set to the name of an existing target.  This
will cause that project to be listed first in the generated solution
file causing Visual Studio to make it the startup project if the
solution has never been opened before.

If this property is not specified, then the ``ALL_BUILD`` project
will be the default.

Properties on Targets
=====================

ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES
----------------------

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of files or directories that will be
removed as a part of the global ``clean`` target.  It can be used to specify
files and directories that are generated as part of building the target or
that are directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. created as a
result of running the target).

For custom targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or byproducts
instead, then that should be preferred over adding them to this property.
If an additional clean file is used by multiple targets or isn't
target-specific, then the ``ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`` directory
property may be the more appropriate property to use.

Relative paths are allowed and are interpreted relative to the
current binary directory.

Contents of ``ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`` may use
``generator expressions``.

This property only works for the ``Ninja`` and the Makefile
generators.  It is ignored by other generators.

ALIASED_TARGET
--------------

Name of target aliased by this target.

If this is an :ref:`Alias Target <Alias Targets>`, this property contains
the name of the target aliased.

ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS
------------------------------

Set the additional options for Android Ant build system. This is
a string value containing all command line options for the Ant build.
This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS`` variable if it is
set when a target is created.

ANDROID_API
-----------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property sets the Android target API version (e.g. ``15``).
The version number must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is
initialized by the value of the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_API`` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

ANDROID_API_MIN
---------------

Set the Android MIN API version (e.g. ``9``).  The version number
must be a positive decimal integer.  This property is initialized by
the value of the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_API_MIN`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.  Native code builds using this API version.

ANDROID_ARCH
------------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property sets the Android target architecture.

This is a string property that could be set to the one of
the following values:

* ``armv7-a``: "ARMv7-A (armv7-a)"
* ``armv7-a-hard``: "ARMv7-A, hard-float ABI (armv7-a)"
* ``arm64-v8a``: "ARMv8-A, 64bit (arm64-v8a)"
* ``x86``: "x86 (x86)"
* ``x86_64``: "x86_64 (x86_64)"

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------

Set the Android assets directories to copy into the main assets
folder before build. This a string property that contains the
directory paths separated by semicolon.
This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES`` variable if it is set when
a target is created.

ANDROID_GUI
-----------

When :ref:`Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio
Edition`, this property specifies whether to build an executable as an
application package on Android.

When this property is set to true the executable when built for Android
will be created as an application package.  This property is initialized
by the value of the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_GUI`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

Add the ``AndroidManifest.xml`` source file explicitly to the
target ``add_executable()`` command invocation to specify the
root directory of the application package source.

ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES
------------------------

Set the Android property that specifies JAR dependencies.
This is a string value property. This property is initialized
by the value of the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES``
variable if it is set when a target is created.

ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------

with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.

ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR
-----------------------

Set the Android property that defines the Java source code root directories.

Set the Android property that specifies the .so dependencies.
This is a string property.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

Contents of ``ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``. See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for
available expressions.

ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------

Set the Android property that specifies directories to search for the ``.so``
libraries.

This a string property that contains the directory paths separated
by semicolons.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

Contents of ``ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.

ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX
-------------------

Set the Android property that defines the maximum number of a
parallel Android NDK compiler processes (e.g. ``4``).
This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

ANDROID_PROGUARD
----------------

When this property is set to true that enables the ProGuard tool to shrink,
optimize, and obfuscate the code by removing unused code and renaming
classes, fields, and methods with semantically obscure names.
This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_PROGUARD`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH

if it is set when a target is created.

ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP
---------------------

Set the Android property that defines whether or not to skip the Ant build step.
This is a boolean property initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP`` variable if it is set when a target is created.

ANDROID_STL_TYPE

Edition`, this property specifies the type of STL support for the project.
This is a string property that could set to the one of the following values:

``none``
  No C++ Support
``system``
  Minimal C++ without STL
``gabi++_static``
  GAbi++ Static
``gabi++_shared``
  GAbi++ Shared
``gnustl_static``
  GNU libstdc++ Static
``gnustl_shared``
  GNU libstdc++ Shared
``stlport_static``
  STLport Static
``stlport_shared``
  STLport Shared

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE`` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for
:ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is a per-configuration version of the
``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` target property, but
multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

Contents of ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
``generator expressions``.

ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------

Output directory in which to build :ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>` target files.

This property specifies the directory into which archive target files
should be built.  The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
is used.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

See also the ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` target property.

ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration output name for
:ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is the configuration-specific version of the
``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME`` target property.

ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME
-------------------

Output name for :ref:`ARCHIVE <Archive Output Artifacts>` target files.

This property specifies the base name for archive target files.  It
overrides ``OUTPUT_NAME`` and ``OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
properties.

See also the ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`` target property.

AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR
-----------------

Directory where ``AUTOMOC``, ``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC``
generate files for the target.

The directory is created on demand and automatically added to the
``ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES`` target property.

When unset or empty the directory ``<dir>/<target-name>_autogen`` is used where
``<dir>`` is ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` and ``<target-name>``
is ``NAME``.

By default ``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR`` is unset.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS
----------------------

Switch for forwarding origin target dependencies to the corresponding
``_autogen`` target.

Targets which have their ``AUTOMOC`` or ``AUTOUIC`` property
``ON`` have a corresponding ``_autogen`` target which generates
``moc`` and ``uic`` files.  As this ``_autogen`` target is created at
generate-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it using
e.g.  ``add_dependencies()``.  Instead the
``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` target property decides whether the origin
target dependencies should be forwarded to the ``_autogen`` target or not.

By default ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` is initialized from
``CMAKE_AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` which is ``ON`` by default.

In total the dependencies of the ``_autogen`` target are composed from

- forwarded origin target dependencies
  (enabled by default via ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS``)
- additional user defined dependencies from ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS``

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Note
^^^^

Disabling ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` is useful to avoid building of
origin target dependencies when building the ``_autogen`` target only.
This is especially interesting when a
``global autogen target`` is enabled.

When the ``_autogen`` target doesn't require all the origin target's
dependencies, and ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` is disabled, it might be
necessary to extend ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`` to add missing
dependencies.

AUTOGEN_PARALLEL
----------------

Number of parallel ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to start when using
``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC``.

The custom `<origin>_autogen` target starts a number of threads of which
each one parses a source file and on demand starts a ``moc`` or ``uic``
process.  ``AUTOGEN_PARALLEL`` controls how many parallel threads
(and therefore ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes) are started.

- An empty (or unset) value or the string ``AUTO`` sets the number of
  threads/processes to the number of physical CPUs on the host system.
- A positive non zero integer value sets the exact thread/process count.
- Otherwise a single thread/process is started.

By default ``AUTOGEN_PARALLEL`` is initialized from
``CMAKE_AUTOGEN_PARALLEL``.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS
----------------------

Additional target dependencies of the corresponding ``_autogen`` target.

Targets which have their ``AUTOMOC`` or ``AUTOUIC`` property
``ON`` have a corresponding ``_autogen`` target which generates
``moc`` and ``uic`` files.  As this ``_autogen`` target is created at
generate-time, it is not possible to define dependencies of it using
e.g.  ``add_dependencies()``.  Instead the
``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`` target property can be set to a
:ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of additional dependencies for the
``_autogen`` target.  Dependencies can be target names or file names.

In total the dependencies of the ``_autogen`` target are composed from

- forwarded origin target dependencies
  (enabled by default via ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS``)
- additional user defined dependencies from ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS``

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Use cases
^^^^^^^^^

If ``AUTOMOC`` or ``AUTOUIC`` depends on a file that is either

- a ``GENERATED`` non C++ file (e.g. a ``GENERATED`` ``.json``
  or ``.ui`` file) or
- a ``GENERATED`` C++ file that isn't recognized by ``AUTOMOC``
  and ``AUTOUIC`` because it's skipped by ``SKIP_AUTOMOC``,
  ``SKIP_AUTOUIC``, ``SKIP_AUTOGEN`` or ``CMP0071`` or
- a file that isn't in the origin target's sources

it must added to ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS``.

AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES
---------------------------

Boolean value used by ``AUTOMOC`` to determine if the
compiler pre definitions file ``moc_predefs.h`` should be generated.

CMake generates a ``moc_predefs.h`` file with compiler pre definitions
from the output of the command defined in
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND``
when

- ``AUTOMOC`` is enabled,
- ``AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES`` is enabled,
- ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_PREDEFINES_COMMAND`` isn't empty and
- the Qt version is greater or equal 5.8.

The ``moc_predefs.h`` file, which is generated in ``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR``,
is passed to ``moc`` as the argument to the ``--include`` option.

By default ``AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES`` is initialized from
``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES``, which is ON by default.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
----------------------

Filter definitions used by ``AUTOMOC`` to extract file names from a
source file that are registered as additional dependencies for the
``moc`` file of the source file.

Filters are defined as ``KEYWORD;REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` pairs. First the file
content is searched for ``KEYWORD``. If it is found at least once, then file
names are extracted by successively searching for ``REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` and
taking the first match group.

The file name found in the first match group is searched for

- first in the vicinity of the source file
- and afterwards in the target's ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

If any of the extracted files changes, then the ``moc`` file for the source
file gets rebuilt even when the source file itself doesn't change.

If any of the extracted files is ``GENERATED`` or if it is not in the
target's sources, then it might be necessary to add it to the
``_autogen`` target  dependencies.
See ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`` for reference.

By default ``AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`` is initialized from
``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS``, which is empty by default.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.


Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

A header file ``my_class.hpp`` uses a custom macro ``JSON_FILE_MACRO`` which
is defined in an other header ``macros.hpp``.
We want the ``moc`` file of ``my_class.hpp`` to depend on the file name
argument of ``JSON_FILE_MACRO``::

 // my_class.hpp
 class My_Class : public QObject
 {
   Q_OBJECT
   JSON_FILE_MACRO ( "info.json" )
 ...
 };

In ``CMakeLists.txt`` we add a filter to
``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS`` like this::

 list( APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
   "JSON_FILE_MACRO"
   "[\n][ \t]*JSON_FILE_MACRO[ \t]*\\([ \t]*\"([^\"]+)\""
 )

We assume ``info.json`` is a plain (not ``GENERATED``) file that is
listed in the target's source.  Therefore we do not need to add it to
``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS``.

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

In the target ``my_target`` a header file ``complex_class.hpp`` uses a
custom macro ``JSON_BASED_CLASS`` which is defined in an other header
``macros.hpp``::

 // macros.hpp
 ...
 #define JSON_BASED_CLASS(name, json) \
 class name : public QObject \
 { \
   Q_OBJECT \
   Q_PLUGIN_METADATA(IID "demo" FILE json) \
   name() {} \
 };
 ...

::

 // complex_class.hpp
 #pragma once
 JSON_BASED_CLASS(Complex_Class, "meta.json")
 // end of file

Since ``complex_class.hpp`` doesn't contain a ``Q_OBJECT`` macro it would be
ignored by ``AUTOMOC``.  We change this by adding ``JSON_BASED_CLASS``
to ``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES``::

 list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "JSON_BASED_CLASS")

We want the ``moc`` file of ``complex_class.hpp`` to depend on
``meta.json``.  So we add a filter to
``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS``::

 list(APPEND CMAKE_AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS
   "JSON_BASED_CLASS"
   "[\n^][ \t]*JSON_BASED_CLASS[ \t]*\\([^,]*,[ \t]*\"([^\"]+)\""
 )

Additionally we assume ``meta.json`` is ``GENERATED`` which is
why we have to add it to ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS``::

 set_property(TARGET my_target APPEND PROPERTY AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS "meta.json")

AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE
------------------

``AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE`` is file path pointing to the ``moc``
executable to use for ``AUTOMOC`` enabled files. Setting
this property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the
``moc`` binary as well as the sanity-tests normally run to ensure
that the binary is available and working as expected.

Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this
property if auto-detection of ``moc`` can not work -- e.g. because
you are building the ``moc`` binary as part of your project.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES
-------------------

A :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` list of macro names used by
``AUTOMOC`` to determine if a C++ file needs to be processed by ``moc``.

This property is only used if the ``AUTOMOC`` property is ``ON``
for this target.

When running ``AUTOMOC``, CMake searches for the strings listed in
``AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`` in C++ source and header files.
If any of the strings is found

- as the first non space string on a new line or
- as the first non space string after a ``{`` on a new line,

then the file will be processed by ``moc``.

By default ``AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`` is initialized from
``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES``.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Example
^^^^^^^

In this case the ``Q_OBJECT`` macro is hidden inside another macro
called ``CUSTOM_MACRO``.  To let CMake know that source files that contain
``CUSTOM_MACRO`` need to be ``moc`` processed, we call::

 set_property(TARGET tgt APPEND PROPERTY AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES "CUSTOM_MACRO")

AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS
-------------------

Additional options for moc when using ``AUTOMOC``

This property is only used if the ``AUTOMOC`` property is ``ON``
for this target.  In this case, it holds additional command line
options which will be used when ``moc`` is executed during the build, i.e.
it is equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the
``qt4_wrap_cpp()`` macro.

By default it is empty.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX
-------------------

When this property is ``ON``, CMake will generate the ``-p`` path prefix
option for ``moc`` on ``AUTOMOC`` enabled Qt targets.

To generate the path prefix, CMake tests if the header compiled by ``moc``
is in any of the target
``include directories``.  If so, CMake will
compute the relative path accordingly.  If the header is not in the
``include directories``, CMake will omit
the ``-p`` path prefix option.  ``moc`` usually generates a
relative include path in that case.

``AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX`` is initialized from the variable
``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX``, which is ``ON`` by default.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Reproducible builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For reproducible builds is is recommended to keep headers that are ``moc``
compiled in one of the target
``include directories`` and set
``AUTOMOC_PATH_PREFIX`` to ``ON`` (which is the default).  This ensures
that

- ``moc`` output files are identical on different build setups,
- ``moc`` output files will compile correctly when the source and/or
  build directory is a symbolic link.

AUTOMOC
-------

Should the target be processed with auto-moc (for Qt projects).

``AUTOMOC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle the Qt
``moc`` preprocessor automatically, i.e.  without having to use the
``QT4_WRAP_CPP()`` or ``QT5_WRAP_CPP()`` macro.
Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.

This property is initialized by the value of the ``CMAKE_AUTOMOC``
variable if it is set when a target is created.

When this property is set ``ON``, CMake will scan the header and
source files at build time and invoke ``moc`` accordingly.


Header file processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At configuration time, a list of header files that should be scanned by
``AUTOMOC`` is computed from the target's sources.

- All header files in the target's sources are added to the scan list.
- For all C++ source files ``<source_base>.<source_extension>`` in the
  target's sources, CMake searches for

  - a regular header with the same base name
    (``<source_base>.<header_extention>``) and
  - a private header with the same base name and a ``_p`` suffix
    (``<source_base>_p.<header_extention>``)

  and adds these to the scan list.

At build time, CMake scans each unknown or modified header file from the
list and searches for

- a Qt macro from ``AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES``,
- additional file dependencies from the ``FILE`` argument of a
  ``Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`` macro and
- additional file dependencies detected by filters defined in
  ``AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS``.

If a Qt macro is found, then the header will be compiled by the ``moc`` to the
output file ``moc_<base_name>.cpp``.  The complete output file path is
described in the section Output file location.

The header will be ``moc`` compiled again if a file from the additional file
dependencies changes.

Header ``moc`` output files ``moc_<base_name>.cpp`` can be included in source
files.  In the section Including header moc files in sources there is more
information on that topic.


Source file processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At build time, CMake scans each unknown or modified C++ source file from the
target's sources for

- a Qt macro from ``AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES``,
- includes of header ``moc`` files
  (see Including header moc files in sources),
- additional file dependencies from the ``FILE`` argument of a
  ``Q_PLUGIN_METADATA`` macro and
- additional file dependencies detected by filters defined in
  ``AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS``.

If a Qt macro is found, then the C++ source file
``<base>.<source_extension>`` is expected to as well contain an include
statement

 #include <<base>.moc> // or
 #include "<base>.moc"

The source file then will be compiled by the ``moc`` to the output file
``<base>.moc``.  A description of the complete output file path is in section
Output file location.

The source will be ``moc`` compiled again if a file from the additional file
dependencies changes.

Including header moc files in sources
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

A source file can include the ``moc`` output file of a header
``<header_base>.<header_extension>`` by using an include statement of
the form

 #include <moc_<header_base>.cpp> // or
 #include "moc_<header_base>.cpp"

If the ``moc`` output file of a header is included by a source, it will
be generated in a different location than if it was not included.  This is
described in the section Output file location.


Output file location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Included moc output files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""

``moc`` output files that are included by a source file will be generated in

- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include``
  for single configuration generators or in
- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``
  for ``multi configuration`` generators.

Where ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>`` is the value of the target property
``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR``.

The include directory is automatically added to the target's
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

Not included moc output files
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

``moc`` output files that are not included in a source file will be generated
in

- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/<SOURCE_DIR_CHECKSUM>``
  for single configuration generators or in,
- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>/<SOURCE_DIR_CHECKSUM>``
  for ``multi configuration`` generators.

Where ``<SOURCE_DIR_CHECKSUM>`` is a checksum computed from the relative
parent directory path of the ``moc`` input file.  This scheme allows to have
``moc`` input files with the same name in different directories.

All not included ``moc`` output files will be included automatically by the
CMake generated file

- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/mocs_compilation.cpp``,

which is added to the target's sources.


Qt version detection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``AUTOMOC`` enabled targets need to know the Qt major and minor
version they're working with.  The major version usually is provided by the
``INTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION`` property of the ``Qt[45]Core`` library,
that the target links to.  To find the minor version, CMake builds a list of
available Qt versions from

- ``Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR`` and ``Qt5Core_VERSION_MINOR`` variables
  (usually set by ``find_package(Qt5...)``)
- ``Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR`` and ``Qt5Core_VERSION_MINOR`` directory properties
- ``QT_VERSION_MAJOR`` and ``QT_VERSION_MINOR``  variables
  (usually set by ``find_package(Qt4...)``)
- ``QT_VERSION_MAJOR`` and ``QT_VERSION_MINOR``  directory properties

in the context of the ``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` call.

Assumed  ``INTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION`` is a valid number, the first
entry in the list with a matching major version is taken.  If no matching major
version was found, an error is generated.
If  ``INTERFACE_QT_MAJOR_VERSION`` is not a valid number, the first
entry in the list is taken.

A ``find_package(Qt[45]...)`` call sets the ``QT/Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR/MINOR``
variables.  If the call is in a different context than the
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` call, e.g. in a function,
then the version variables might not be available to the ``AUTOMOC``
enabled target.
In that case the version variables can be forwarded from the
`find_package(Qt[45]...)` calling context to the ``add_executable()``
or ``add_library()`` calling context as directory properties.
The following Qt5 example demonstrates the procedure.

 function (add_qt5_client)
   find_package(Qt5 REQUIRED QUIET COMPONENTS Core Widgets)
   ...
   set_property(DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
     PROPERTY Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR "${Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR}")
   set_property(DIRECTORY "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}"
     PROPERTY Qt5Core_VERSION_MINOR "${Qt5Core_VERSION_MAJOR}")
   ...
 endfunction ()
 ...
 add_qt5_client()
 add_executable(myTarget main.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(myTarget Qt5::QtWidgets)
 set_property(TARGET myTarget PROPERTY AUTOMOC ON)

Modifiers
^^^^^^^^^

``AUTOMOC_EXECUTABLE``:

This list of Qt macro names can be extended to search for additional macros in
headers and sources.

``AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS``:
``moc`` dependency file names can be extracted from headers or sources by
defining file name filters in this target property.

``AUTOMOC_COMPILER_PREDEFINES``:

The generation of this file can be enabled or disabled in this target property.

``SKIP_AUTOMOC``:
Sources and headers can be excluded from ``AUTOMOC`` processing by
setting this source file property.

``SKIP_AUTOGEN``:
Source files can be excluded from ``AUTOMOC``,
``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC`` processing by
setting this source file property.

``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC`` targets together in an IDE,
e.g.  in MSVS.

``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET``:
A global ``autogen`` target, that depends on all ``AUTOMOC`` or
``AUTOUIC`` generated ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` targets in the project,
will be generated when this variable is ``ON``.

``AUTOGEN_PARALLEL``:
This target property controls the number of ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to
start in parallel during builds.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOUIC
-------

Should the target be processed with auto-uic (for Qt projects).

``AUTOUIC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt ``uic`` code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the ``QT4_WRAP_UI()`` or ``QT5_WRAP_UI()`` macro. Currently
Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.

This property is initialized by the value of the ``CMAKE_AUTOUIC``
variable if it is set when a target is created.

When this property is ``ON``, CMake will scan the header and source files at
build time and invoke ``uic`` accordingly.


Header and source file processing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At build time, CMake scans each header and source file from the
target's sources for include statements of the form

 #include "ui_<ui_base>.h"

Once such an include statement is found in a file, CMake searches for the
``uic`` input file ``<ui_base>.ui``

- in the vicinity of the file and
- in the ``AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS`` of the target.

If the ``<ui_base>.ui`` file was found, ``uic`` is called on it to generate
``ui_<ui_base>.h`` in the directory

- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include`` for single configuration generators or in
- ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>`` for
  ``multi configuration`` generators.

Where ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>`` is the value of the target property
``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR``.

The include directory is automatically added to the target's
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.


Modifiers
^^^^^^^^^

``AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE``:
The ``uic`` executable will be detected automatically, but can be forced to
a certain binary using this target property.

``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS``: Additional command line options for ``uic`` can
be set via this source file property on a ``<base_name>.ui`` file.

``SKIP_AUTOUIC``:
Source files can be excluded from ``AUTOUIC`` processing by setting
this source file property.

``SKIP_AUTOGEN``:
Source files can be excluded from ``AUTOMOC``,
``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC`` processing by
setting this source file property.

``AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER``:
This global property can be used to group ``AUTOMOC``,
``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC`` targets together in an IDE,
e.g.  in MSVS.

``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET``:
A global ``autogen`` target, that depends on all ``AUTOMOC`` or
``AUTOUIC`` generated ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` targets in the project,
will be generated when this variable is ``ON``.

``AUTOGEN_PARALLEL``:
This target property controls the number of ``moc`` or ``uic`` processes to
start in parallel during builds.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE
------------------

``AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE`` is file path pointing to the ``uic``
executable to use for ``AUTOUIC`` enabled files. Setting
this property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the
``uic`` binary as well as the sanity-tests normally run to ensure
that the binary is available and working as expected.

Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this
property if auto-detection of ``uic`` can not work -- e.g. because
you are building the ``uic`` binary as part of your project.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``uic`` when using ``AUTOUIC``

This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
``uic`` is executed during the build via ``AUTOUIC``, i.e. it is
equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the
``qt4_wrap_ui()`` macro.

By default it is empty.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

The options set on the target may be overridden by ``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS``
set on the ``.ui`` source file.

This property may use "generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.
See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available
expressions.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
 # ...

AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS
--------------------

Search path list used by ``AUTOUIC`` to find included
``.ui`` files.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS`` variable if it is set
when a target is created. Otherwise it is empty.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTORCC
-------

Should the target be processed with auto-rcc (for Qt projects).

``AUTORCC`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will handle
the Qt ``rcc`` code generator automatically, i.e. without having to use
the ``QT4_ADD_RESOURCES()`` or ``QT5_ADD_RESOURCES()``
macro.  Currently Qt4 and Qt5 are supported.

When this property is ``ON``, CMake will handle ``.qrc`` files added
as target sources at build time and invoke ``rcc`` accordingly.
This property is initialized by the value of the ``CMAKE_AUTORCC``
variable if it is set when a target is created.

By default ``AUTORCC`` is processed by a
``custom command``.
If the ``.qrc`` file is ``GENERATED``, a
``custom target`` is used instead.

When there are multiple ``.qrc`` files with the same name, CMake will
generate unspecified unique output file names for ``rcc``.  Therefore, if
``Q_INIT_RESOURCE()`` or ``Q_CLEANUP_RESOURCE()`` need to be used, the
``.qrc`` file name must be unique.


Modifiers
^^^^^^^^^

``AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE``:
The ``rcc`` executable will be detected automatically, but can be forced to
a certain binary by setting this target property.

``AUTORCC_OPTIONS``:
Additional command line options for ``rcc`` can be set via this ``.qrc``
source file property.

``SKIP_AUTORCC``:
``.qrc`` files can be excluded from ``AUTORCC`` processing by
setting this source file property.

``SKIP_AUTOGEN``:
Source files can be excluded from ``AUTOMOC``,
``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC`` processing by
setting this source file property.

``AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP``:
This global property can be used to group files generated by
``AUTOMOC`` or ``AUTORCC`` together in an IDE, e.g.  in MSVS.

``AUTOGEN_TARGETS_FOLDER``:
This global property can be used to group ``AUTOMOC``,
``AUTOUIC`` and ``AUTORCC`` targets together in an IDE,
e.g.  in MSVS.

``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET``:
A global ``autorcc`` target that depends on all ``AUTORCC`` targets
in the project will be generated when this variable is ``ON``.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE
------------------

``AUTORCC_EXECUTABLE`` is file path pointing to the ``rcc``
executable to use for ``AUTORCC`` enabled files. Setting
this property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the
``rcc`` binary as well as the sanity-tests normally run to ensure
that the binary is available and working as expected.

Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this
property if auto-detection of ``rcc`` can not work -- e.g. because
you are building the ``rcc`` binary as part of your project.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

AUTORCC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``rcc`` when using ``AUTORCC``

This property holds additional command line options which will be used
when ``rcc`` is executed during the build via ``AUTORCC``,
i.e. it is equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the
``qt4_add_resources()`` macro.

By default it is empty.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS`` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

The options set on the target may be overridden by ``AUTORCC_OPTIONS``
set on the ``.qrc`` source file.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
 # ...

BINARY_DIR
----------

This read-only property reports the value of the
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` variable in the directory in which
the target was defined.

BUILD_RPATH
-----------

A :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` specifying runtime path (``RPATH``)
entries to add to binaries linked in the build tree (for platforms that
support it).  The entries will *not* be used for binaries in the install
tree.  See also the ``INSTALL_RPATH`` target property.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH`` if it is set when a target is created.

This property supports
``generator expressions``.

BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN
----------------------

Whether to use relative paths for the build ``RPATH``.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH_USE_ORIGIN``.

On platforms that support runtime paths (``RPATH``) with the
``$ORIGIN`` token, setting this property to ``TRUE`` enables relative
paths in the build ``RPATH`` for executables and shared libraries that
point to shared libraries in the same build tree.

Normally the build ``RPATH`` of a binary contains absolute paths
to the directory of each shared library it links to.  The ``RPATH``
entries for directories contained within the build tree can be made
relative to enable relocatable builds and to help achieve reproducible
builds by omitting the build directory from the build environment.

This property has no effect on platforms that do not support the
``$ORIGIN`` token in ``RPATH``, or when the ``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH``
variable is set. The runtime path set through the
``BUILD_RPATH`` target property is also unaffected by this
property.

BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR
---------------------------

``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` is a boolean specifying whether the macOS
``install_name`` of a target in the build tree uses the directory given by
``INSTALL_NAME_DIR``.  This setting only applies to targets on macOS.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` if it is set when a target is
created.

If this property is not set and policy ``CMP0068`` is not ``NEW``, the
value of ``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` is used in its place.

BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH
------------------------

``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` is a boolean specifying whether to link the target
in the build tree with the ``INSTALL_RPATH``.  This takes precedence
over ``SKIP_BUILD_RPATH`` and avoids the need for relinking before
installation.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_RPATH`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

If policy ``CMP0068`` is not ``NEW``, this property also controls use of
``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` in the build tree on macOS.  Either way, the
``BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` target property takes precedence.

BUNDLE_EXTENSION
----------------

The file extension used to name a ``BUNDLE``, a ``FRAMEWORK``,
or a ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` target on the macOS and iOS.

The default value is ``bundle``, ``framework``, or ``app`` for the respective
target types.

BUNDLE
------

This target is a ``CFBundle`` on the macOS.

If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a ``CFBundle`` when built on the mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a ``CFBundle`` and will be suitable to be used for
creating Browser Plugins or other application resources.

C_EXTENSIONS
------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu11`` instead of ``-std=c11`` to the compile line.  This
property is ``ON`` by default. The basic C standard level is
controlled by the ``C_STANDARD`` target property.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_C_EXTENSIONS`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

C_STANDARD
----------

The C standard whose features are requested to build this target.

This property specifies the C standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=gnu11`` to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.

Supported values are ``90``, ``99`` and ``11``.

If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

 set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY C_STANDARD 11)

with a compiler which does not support ``-std=gnu11`` or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
``-std=gnu99`` or ``-std=gnu90`` flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may
be controlled with the ``C_STANDARD_REQUIRED`` target property.
Additionally, the ``C_EXTENSIONS`` target property may be used to
control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_C_STANDARD`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

C_STANDARD_REQUIRED
-------------------

Boolean describing whether the value of ``C_STANDARD`` is a requirement.

If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the
``C_STANDARD`` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is ``OFF`` or unset, the ``C_STANDARD`` target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_C_STANDARD_REQUIRED`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
-----------------------

By setting this target property, the target is configured to build with
``C++/CLI`` support.

The Visual Studio generator defines the ``clr`` parameter depending on
the value of ``COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME``:

* property not set: native C++ (i.e. default)
* property set but empty: mixed unmanaged/managed C++
* property set to any non empty value: managed C++

Supported values: ``""``, ``"pure"``, ``"safe"``

This property is only evaluated :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for
VS 2010 and above.

To be able to build managed C++ targets with VS 2017 and above the component
``C++/CLI support`` must be installed, which may not be done by default.

See also ``IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME``

COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL
-------------------------

Properties which must be compatible with their link interface

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a
boolean with the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all linked
dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then
for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its
dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the ``FOO``
property in the depender.

Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set,
then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the
property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.

COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX
-------------------------------

Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MAX`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose maximum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all
linked dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list,
then for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of
its dependencies will be compared with each other and with the ``FOO``
property in the depender.  When reading the ``FOO`` property at generate
time, the maximum value will be returned. If the property is not set,
then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.

COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN
-------------------------------

Properties whose maximum value from the link interface will be used.

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_NUMBER_MIN`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target whose minimum value may be read at generate
time when evaluated in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property of all
linked dependees.  For example, if a
property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each dependee, the
``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its dependencies will be
compared with each other and with the ``FOO`` property in the depender.
When reading the ``FOO`` property at generate time, the minimum value
will be returned.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.

COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING
---------------------------

Properties which must be string-compatible with their link interface

The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING`` property may contain a list of
properties for this target which must be the same when evaluated as a
string in the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property all linked dependees.
For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each
dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its
dependencies must be equal with each other, and with the ``FOO`` property
in the depender.  If the property is not set, then it is ignored.

Note that for each dependee, the set of properties specified in this
property must not intersect with the set specified in any of the other
:ref:`Compatible Interface Properties`.

COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-------------------

Preprocessor definitions for compiling a target's sources.

The ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property may be set to a semicolon-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.

Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include::

 #          - broken almost everywhere
 ;          - broken in VS IDE 7.0 and Borland Makefiles
 ,          - broken in VS IDE
 %          - broken in some cases in NMake
 & |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
 ^ < > \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
some cases.  Use with caution.

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

The corresponding ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` property may
be set to specify per-configuration definitions.  Generator expressions
should be preferred instead of setting the alternative property.

COMPILE_FEATURES
----------------

Compiler features enabled for this target.

The list of features in this property are a subset of the features listed
in the ``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILE_FEATURES`` variable.

Contents of ``COMPILE_FEATURES`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for
available expressions.  See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual
for information on compile features and a list of supported compilers.

COMPILE_FLAGS
-------------

Additional flags to use when compiling this target's sources.

The ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` property sets additional compiler flags used to
build sources within the target.  Use ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
to pass additional preprocessor definitions.

This property is deprecated.  Use the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``
property or the ``target_compile_options()`` command instead.

COMPILE_OPTIONS
---------------

List of options to pass to the compiler.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
specified so far for its target.  Use the ``target_compile_options()``
command to append more options.

This property is initialized by the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` directory
property when a target is created, and is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.

Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

COMPILE_PDB_NAME
----------------

Output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file generated by the
compiler while building source files.

This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.
If not set, the default is unspecified.

.. note::
 The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/Fd`` compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/pdb`` linker flag.
 Use the ``PDB_NAME`` property to specify the latter.

COMPILE_PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

Per-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``COMPILE_PDB_NAME``.

.. note::
 The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/Fd`` compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/pdb`` linker flag.
 Use the ``PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>`` property to specify the latter.

COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
----------------------------

Output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the compiler.  This property is initialized by the
value of the ``CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` variable
if it is set when a target is created.

.. note::
 The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/Fd`` compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/pdb`` linker flag.
 Use the ``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` property to specify the latter.

COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This is a per-configuration version of
``COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``,
but multi-configuration generators (Visual Studio, Xcode) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` variable
if it is set when a target is created.

.. note::
 The compiler-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/Fd`` compiler flag and are not the same as linker-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/pdb`` linker flag.
 Use the ``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` property to specify the latter.

<CONFIG>_OUTPUT_NAME
--------------------

Old per-configuration target file base name.
Use ``OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`` instead.

This is a configuration-specific version of the ``OUTPUT_NAME``
target property.

<CONFIG>_POSTFIX
----------------

Postfix to append to the target file name for configuration <CONFIG>.

When building with configuration <CONFIG> the value of this property
is appended to the target file name built on disk.  For non-executable
targets, this property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_<CONFIG>_POSTFIX if it is set when a target is created.  This
property is ignored on the Mac for Frameworks and App Bundles.

CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
-----------------------

Use the given emulator to run executables created when crosscompiling.
This command will be added as a prefix to ``add_test()``,
``add_custom_command()``, and ``add_custom_target()`` commands
for built target system executables.

If this property contains a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language
Lists>`, then the first value is the command and remaining values are its
arguments.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION
--------------------

Compile CUDA sources to ``.ptx`` files instead of ``.obj`` files
within :ref:`Object Libraries`.

For example:

 add_library(myptx OBJECT a.cu b.cu)
 set_property(TARGET myptx PROPERTY CUDA_PTX_COMPILATION ON)

CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION
--------------------------

CUDA only: Enables separate compilation of device code

If set this will enable separable compilation for all CUDA files for
the given target.

For instance:

 set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION ON)

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS
---------------------------

CUDA only: Enables device linking for the specific library target where
required.

If set, this will tell the required compilers to enable device linking
on the library target. Device linking is an additional link step
required by some CUDA compilers when ``CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION`` is
enabled. Normally device linking is deferred until a shared library or
executable is generated, allowing for multiple static libraries to resolve
device symbols at the same time when they are used by a shared library or
executable.

By default static library targets have this property is disabled,
while shared, module, and executable targets have this property enabled.

Note that device linking is not supported for :ref:`Object Libraries`.


For instance:

 set_property(TARGET mystaticlib PROPERTY CUDA_RESOLVE_DEVICE_SYMBOLS ON)

CUDA_EXTENSIONS
---------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.  This
property is ``ON`` by default. The basic CUDA/C++ standard level is
controlled by the ``CUDA_STANDARD`` target property.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_CUDA_EXTENSIONS`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

CUDA_STANDARD
-------------

The CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

This property specifies the CUDA/C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=gnu++11`` to the compile line.

Supported values are ``98``, ``11``, ``14``.

If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

 set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CUDA_STANDARD 11)

with a compiler which does not support ``-std=gnu++11`` or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
``-std=gnu++98`` flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may be controlled
with the ``CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED`` target property.
Additionally, the ``CUDA_EXTENSIONS`` target property may be used to
control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED
----------------------

Boolean describing whether the value of ``CUDA_STANDARD`` is a requirement.

If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the
``CUDA_STANDARD`` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is ``OFF`` or unset, the ``CUDA_STANDARD`` target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_CUDA_STANDARD_REQUIRED`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

CXX_EXTENSIONS
--------------

Boolean specifying whether compiler specific extensions are requested.

This property specifies whether compiler specific extensions should be
used.  For some compilers, this results in adding a flag such
as ``-std=gnu++11`` instead of ``-std=c++11`` to the compile line.  This
property is ``ON`` by default. The basic C++ standard level is
controlled by the ``CXX_STANDARD`` target property.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_CXX_EXTENSIONS`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

CXX_STANDARD
------------

The C++ standard whose features are requested to build this target.

This property specifies the C++ standard whose features are requested
to build this target.  For some compilers, this results in adding a
flag such as ``-std=gnu++11`` to the compile line.  For compilers that
have no notion of a standard level, such as Microsoft Visual C++ before
2015 Update 3, this has no effect.

Supported values are ``98``, ``11``, ``14``, ``17``, and ``20``.

If the value requested does not result in a compile flag being added for
the compiler in use, a previous standard flag will be added instead.  This
means that using:

 set_property(TARGET tgt PROPERTY CXX_STANDARD 11)

with a compiler which does not support ``-std=gnu++11`` or an equivalent
flag will not result in an error or warning, but will instead add the
``-std=gnu++98`` flag if supported.  This "decay" behavior may be controlled
with the ``CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED`` target property.
Additionally, the ``CXX_EXTENSIONS`` target property may be used to
control whether compiler-specific extensions are enabled on a per-target basis.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED
---------------------

Boolean describing whether the value of ``CXX_STANDARD`` is a requirement.

If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the
``CXX_STANDARD`` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this
property is ``OFF`` or unset, the ``CXX_STANDARD`` target property is
treated as optional and may "decay" to a previous standard if the requested is
not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as
MSVC, this has no effect.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on
compile features and a list of supported compilers.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

DEBUG_POSTFIX
-------------

See target property ``<CONFIG>_POSTFIX``.

This property is a special case of the more-general ``<CONFIG>_POSTFIX``
property for the ``DEBUG`` configuration.

DEFINE_SYMBOL
-------------

Define a symbol when compiling this target's sources.

``DEFINE_SYMBOL`` sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when
compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set
to ``target_EXPORTS`` by default (with some substitutions if the target is
not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether
they are being included from inside their library or outside to
properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations.

DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY
---------------------------

Set the WinCE project ``RemoteDirectory`` in ``DeploymentTool`` and
``RemoteExecutable`` in ``DebuggerTool`` in ``.vcproj`` files generated
by the ``Visual Studio 9 2008`` generator.
This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE device.
For example:

 set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY
   DEPLOYMENT_REMOTE_DIRECTORY "\\FlashStorage")

produces::

 <DeploymentTool RemoteDirectory="\FlashStorage" ... />
 <DebuggerTool RemoteExecutable="\FlashStorage\target_file" ... />

DEPLOYMENT_ADDITIONAL_FILES
---------------------------

Set the WinCE project ``AdditionalFiles`` in ``DeploymentTool`` in ``.vcproj``
files generated by the ``Visual Studio 9 2008`` generator.
This is useful when you want to debug on remote WinCE device.
Specify additional files that will be copied to the device.
For example:

 set_property(TARGET ${TARGET} PROPERTY
   DEPLOYMENT_ADDITIONAL_FILES "english.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0"
   "german.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0")

produces::

 <DeploymentTool AdditionalFiles="english.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0;german.lng|local_folder|remote_folder|0" ... />

DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
--------------------------

Disables the precompilation of header files specified by
``PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` property.

If the property is not set, CMake will use the value provided
by ``CMAKE_DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS``.

DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
-------------------------------

Specify the .NET target framework version.

Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI.  For
example: ``v4.5``.

This property is only evaluated for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
VS 2010 and above.

Can be initialized for all targets using the variable
``CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION``.

EchoString
----------

A message to be displayed when the target is built.

A message to display on some generators (such as :ref:`Makefile Generators`)
when the target is built.

ENABLE_EXPORTS
--------------

Specify whether an executable exports symbols for loadable modules.

Normally an executable does not export any symbols because it is the
final program.  It is possible for an executable to export symbols to
be used by loadable modules.  When this property is set to true CMake
will allow other targets to "link" to the executable with the
``target_link_libraries()`` command.  On all platforms a target-level
dependency on the executable is created for targets that link to it.
Handling of the executable on the link lines of the loadable modules
varies by platform:

* On Windows-based systems (including Cygwin) an "import library" is
  created along with the executable to list the exported symbols.
  Loadable modules link to the import library to get the symbols.

* On macOS, loadable modules link to the executable itself using the
  ``-bundle_loader`` flag.

* On AIX, a linker "import file" is created along with the executable
  to list the exported symbols for import when linking other targets.
  Loadable modules link to the import file to get the symbols.

* On other platforms, loadable modules are simply linked without
  referencing the executable since the dynamic loader will
  automatically bind symbols when the module is loaded.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_ENABLE_EXPORTS`` if it is set when a target is created.

EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL
----------------

Set this target property to a true (or false) value to exclude (or include)
the target from the "all" target of the containing directory and its
ancestors.  If excluded, running e.g. ``make`` in the containing directory
or its ancestors will not build the target by default.

If this target property is not set then the target will be included in
the "all" target of the containing directory.  Furthermore, it will be
included in the "all" target of its ancestor directories unless the
``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` directory property is set.

With ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` set to false or not set at all, the target
will be brought up to date as part of doing a ``make install`` or its
equivalent for the CMake generator being used.  If a target has
``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` set to true, then any attempt to install that
target has undefined behavior.  Note that such a target can still safely
be listed in an ``install(TARGETS)`` command as long as the install
components the target belongs to are not part of the set of components
that anything tries to install.

EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------------

Per-configuration version of target exclusion from ``Build Solution``.

This is the configuration-specific version of
``EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD``.  If the generic
``EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD`` is also set on a target,
``EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD_<CONFIG>`` takes
precedence in configurations for which it has a value.

EXCLUDE_FROM_DEFAULT_BUILD
--------------------------

Exclude target from ``Build Solution``.

This property is only used by Visual Studio generators.
When set to ``TRUE``, the target will not be built when you press
``Build Solution``.

EXPORT_NAME
-----------

Exported name for target files.

This sets the name for the ``IMPORTED`` target generated by the
``install(EXPORT)`` and ``export()`` commands.
If not set, the logical target name is used by default.

EXPORT_PROPERTIES
-----------------

List additional properties to export for a target.

This property contains a list of property names that should be exported by
the ``install(EXPORT)`` and ``export()`` commands.  By default
only a limited number of properties are exported. This property can be used
to additionally export other properties as well.

Properties starting with ``INTERFACE_`` or ``IMPORTED_`` are not allowed as
they are reserved for internal CMake use.

Properties containing generator expressions are also not allowed.

FOLDER
------

Set the folder name. Use to organize targets in an IDE.

Targets with no ``FOLDER`` property will appear as top level entities in
IDEs like Visual Studio.  Targets with the same ``FOLDER`` property value
will appear next to each other in a folder of that name.  To nest
folders, use ``FOLDER`` values such as 'GUI/Dialogs' with '/' characters
separating folder levels.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_FOLDER`` if it is set when a target is created.

Fortran_FORMAT
--------------

Set to ``FIXED`` or ``FREE`` to indicate the Fortran source layout.

This property tells CMake whether the Fortran source files in a target
use fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding
format flag to the compiler.  Use the source-specific ``Fortran_FORMAT``
property to change the format of a specific source file.  If the
variable ``CMAKE_Fortran_FORMAT`` is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.

Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY
------------------------

Specify output directory for Fortran modules provided by the target.

If the target contains Fortran source files that provide modules and
the compiler supports a module output directory this specifies the
directory in which the modules will be placed.  When this property is
not set the modules will be placed in the build directory
corresponding to the target's source directory.  If the variable
``CMAKE_Fortran_MODULE_DIRECTORY`` is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.

Note that some compilers will automatically search the module output
directory for modules USEd during compilation but others will not.  If
your sources USE modules their location must be specified by
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` regardless of this property.

FRAMEWORK
---------

Build ``SHARED`` or ``STATIC`` library as Framework Bundle on the macOS and iOS.

If such a library target has this property set to ``TRUE`` it will be
built as a framework when built on the macOS and iOS.  It will have the
directory structure required for a framework and will be suitable to
be used with the ``-framework`` option.  This property is initialized by the
value of the ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK`` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

To customize ``Info.plist`` file in the framework, use
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST`` target property.

For macOS see also the ``FRAMEWORK_VERSION`` target property.

Example of creation ``dynamicFramework``:

 add_library(dynamicFramework SHARED
             dynamicFramework.c
             dynamicFramework.h
 )
 set_target_properties(dynamicFramework PROPERTIES
   FRAMEWORK TRUE
   FRAMEWORK_VERSION C
   MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER com.cmake.dynamicFramework
   MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST Info.plist
   # "current version" in semantic format in Mach-O binary file
   VERSION 16.4.0
   # "compatibility version" in semantic format in Mach-O binary file
   SOVERSION 1.0.0
   PUBLIC_HEADER dynamicFramework.h
   XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_CODE_SIGN_IDENTITY "iPhone Developer"
 )

FRAMEWORK_VERSION
-----------------

Version of a framework created using the ``FRAMEWORK`` target
property (e.g. ``A``).

This property only affects macOS, as iOS doesn't have versioned
directory structure.

GENERATOR_FILE_NAME
-------------------

Generator's file for this target.

An internal property used by some generators to record the name of the
project or dsp file associated with this target.  Note that at
configure time, this property is only set for targets created by
``include_external_msproject()``.

GHS_INTEGRITY_APP
-----------------

``ON`` / ``OFF`` boolean to determine if an executable target should
be treated as an `Integrity Application`.

If no value is set and if a ``.int`` file is added as a source file to the
executable target it will be treated as an `Integrity Application`.

Supported on ``Green Hills MULTI``.

GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE
------------------------

``ON`` / ``OFF`` boolean to control if the project file for a target should
be one single file or multiple files.

The default behavior or when the property is ``OFF`` is to generate a project
file for the target and then a sub-project file for each source group.

When this property is ``ON`` or if ``CMAKE_GHS_NO_SOURCE_GROUP_FILE``
is ``ON`` then only a single project file is generated for the target.

Supported on ``Green Hills MULTI``.

GNUtoMS
-------

Convert GNU import library (``.dll.a``) to MS format (``.lib``).

When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using
GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert
the import library (``.dll.a``) from GNU to MS format (``.lib``).  Both import
libraries will be installed by ``install(TARGETS)`` and exported by
``install(EXPORT)`` and  ``export()`` to be linked
by applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools.

If the variable ``CMAKE_GNUtoMS`` is set when a target is created its
value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set
prior to the first command that enables a language such as ``project()``
or ``enable_language()``.  CMake provides the variable as an option to the
user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools.

HAS_CXX
-------

Link the target using the C++ linker tool (obsolete).

This is equivalent to setting the ``LINKER_LANGUAGE``
property to ``CXX``.

IMPLICIT_DEPENDS_INCLUDE_TRANSFORM
----------------------------------

Specify #include line transforms for dependencies in a target.

This property specifies rules to transform macro-like #include lines
during implicit dependency scanning of C and C++ source files.  The
list of rules must be semicolon-separated with each entry of the form
"A_MACRO(%)=value-with-%" (the % must be literal).  During dependency
scanning occurrences of A_MACRO(...) on #include lines will be
replaced by the value given with the macro argument substituted for
'%'.  For example, the entry

::

 MYDIR(%)=<mydir/%>

will convert lines of the form

::

 #include MYDIR(myheader.h)

to

::

 #include <mydir/myheader.h>

allowing the dependency to be followed.

This property applies to sources in the target on which it is set.

IMPORTED_COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME
--------------------------------

Property to define if the target uses ``C++/CLI``.

Ignored for non-imported targets.

See also the ``COMMON_LANGUAGE_RUNTIME`` target property.

IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS
-----------------------

Configurations provided for an IMPORTED target.

Set this to the list of configuration names available for an IMPORTED
target.  The names correspond to configurations defined in the project
from which the target is imported.  If the importing project uses a
different set of configurations the names may be mapped using the
MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property.  Ignored for non-imported
targets.

IMPORTED_GLOBAL
---------------

Indication of whether an :ref:`IMPORTED target <Imported Targets>` is
globally visible.

The boolean value of this property is True for targets created with the
``IMPORTED`` ``GLOBAL`` options to ``add_executable()`` or
``add_library()``. It is always False for targets built within the
project.

For targets created with the ``IMPORTED`` option to
``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()`` but without the
additional option ``GLOBAL`` this is False, too. However, setting this
property for such a locally ``IMPORTED`` target to True promotes that
target to global scope. This promotion can only be done in the same
directory where that ``IMPORTED`` target was created in the first place.

Once an imported target has been made global, it cannot be changed back to
non-global. Therefore, if a project sets this property, it may only
provide a value of True. CMake will issue an error if the project tries to
set the property to a non-True value, even if the value was already False.

IMPORTED_IMPLIB_<CONFIG>
------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_IMPLIB`` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.

IMPORTED_IMPLIB
---------------

Full path to the import library for an ``IMPORTED`` target.

Set this to the location of the ``.lib`` part of a Windows DLL, or on
AIX set it to an import file created for executables that export symbols
(see the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property).
Ignored for non-imported targets.

IMPORTED_LIBNAME_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.

IMPORTED_LIBNAME
----------------

Specify the link library name for an :ref:`imported <Imported Targets>`
:ref:`Interface Library <Interface Libraries>`.

An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify
usage requirements for its consumers.  The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME``
property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed
on the link line in place of the interface library target name as
a requirement for using the interface.

This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by
a platform SDK for which the full path to a library file may not
be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as ``foo``
but may *not* be a path (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so``) or a flag
(e.g. ``-Wl,...``).  The name is never treated as a library target
name even if it happens to name one.

The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property is allowed only on
:ref:`imported <Imported Targets>` :ref:`Interface Libraries`
and is rejected on targets of other types (for which
the ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` target property may be used).

IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES``.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

IMPORTED_LINK_DEPENDENT_LIBRARIES
---------------------------------

Dependent shared libraries of an imported shared library.

Shared libraries may be linked to other shared libraries as part of
their implementation.  On some platforms the linker searches for the
dependent libraries of shared libraries they are including in the
link.  Set this property to the list of dependent shared libraries of
an imported library.  The list should be disjoint from the list of
interface libraries in the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property.  On
platforms requiring dependent shared libraries to be found at link
time CMake uses this list to add appropriate files or paths to the
link command line.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES``.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES
---------------------------------

Languages compiled into an ``IMPORTED`` static library.

Set this to the list of languages of source files compiled to produce
a ``STATIC IMPORTED`` library (such as ``C`` or ``CXX``).  CMake accounts for
these languages when computing how to link a target to the imported
library.  For example, when a C executable links to an imported C++
static library CMake chooses the C++ linker to satisfy language
runtime dependencies of the static library.

This property is ignored for targets that are not ``STATIC`` libraries.
This property is ignored for non-imported targets.

IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES``.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

This property is ignored if the target also has a non-empty
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property.

This property is deprecated.  Use ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` instead.

IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
---------------------------------

Transitive link interface of an ``IMPORTED`` target.

Set this to the list of libraries whose interface is included when an
``IMPORTED`` library target is linked to another target.  The libraries
will be included on the link line for the target.  Unlike the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` property, this property applies to all
imported target types, including ``STATIC`` libraries.  This property is
ignored for non-imported targets.

This property is ignored if the target also has a non-empty
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` property.

This property is deprecated.  Use ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` instead.

IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY``.

If set, this property completely overrides the generic property for
the named configuration.

IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
------------------------------------

Repetition count for cycles of ``IMPORTED`` static libraries.

This is ``LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY`` for ``IMPORTED`` targets.

IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>
--------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.

IMPORTED_LOCATION
-----------------

Full path to the main file on disk for an ``IMPORTED`` target.

Set this to the location of an ``IMPORTED`` target file on disk.  For
executables this is the location of the executable file.  For bundles
on macOS this is the location of the executable file inside
``Contents/MacOS`` under the application bundle folder.  For ``STATIC``
libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module.
For ``SHARED`` libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the
shared library.  For frameworks on macOS this is the location of the
library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this
is the location of the ``.dll`` part of the library.  For ``UNKNOWN``
libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for
non-imported targets.

The ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` target property may be overridden for a
given configuration ``<CONFIG>`` by the configuration-specific
``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`` target property.  Furthermore,
the ``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>`` target property may be
used to map between a project's configurations and those of an imported
target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration
listed in the ``IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS`` target property may be
selected and its ``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`` value used.

To get the location of an imported target read one of the ``LOCATION``
or ``LOCATION_<CONFIG>`` properties.

IMPORTED_NO_SONAME_<CONFIG>
---------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_NO_SONAME`` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.

IMPORTED_NO_SONAME
------------------

Specifies that an ``IMPORTED`` shared library target has no ``soname``.

Set this property to true for an imported shared library file that has
no ``soname`` field.  CMake may adjust generated link commands for some
platforms to prevent the linker from using the path to the library in
place of its missing ``soname``.  Ignored for non-imported targets.

IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>
-------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_OBJECTS`` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.

IMPORTED_OBJECTS
----------------

A :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of absolute paths to the object
files on disk for an :ref:`imported <Imported targets>`
:ref:`object library <object libraries>`.

Ignored for non-imported targets.

Projects may skip ``IMPORTED_OBJECTS`` if the configuration-specific
property ``IMPORTED_OBJECTS_<CONFIG>`` is set instead.

IMPORTED
--------

Read-only indication of whether a target is ``IMPORTED``.

The boolean value of this property is ``True`` for targets created with
the ``IMPORTED`` option to ``add_executable()`` or ``add_library()``.
It is ``False`` for targets built within the project.

IMPORTED_SONAME_<CONFIG>
------------------------

<CONFIG>-specific version of ``IMPORTED_SONAME`` property.

Configuration names correspond to those provided by the project from
which the target is imported.

IMPORTED_SONAME
---------------

The ``soname`` of an ``IMPORTED`` target of shared library type.

Set this to the ``soname`` embedded in an imported shared library.  This
is meaningful only on platforms supporting the feature.  Ignored for
non-imported targets.

IMPORT_PREFIX
-------------

What comes before the import library name.

Similar to the target property ``PREFIX``, but used for import libraries
(typically corresponding to a ``DLL``) instead of regular libraries.  A
target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as ``lib``)
on an import library name.

IMPORT_SUFFIX
-------------

What comes after the import library name.

Similar to the target property ``SUFFIX``, but used
for import libraries (typically corresponding to a ``DLL``) instead of
regular libraries.  A target property that can be set to override
the suffix (such as ``.lib``) on an import library name.

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------

List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the
``target_include_directories()`` command.  In addition to accepting
values from that command, values may be set directly on any
target using the ``set_property()`` command.  A target gets its
initial value for this property from the value of the
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` directory property.  Both directory and
target property values are adjusted by calls to the
``include_directories()`` command.

The value of this property is used by the generators to set the include
paths for the compiler.

Relative paths should not be added to this property directly. Use one of
the commands above instead to handle relative paths.

Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INSTALL_NAME_DIR
----------------

macOS directory name for installed targets.

``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` is a string specifying the directory portion of the
"install_name" field of shared libraries on macOS to use in the
installed targets.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` if it is set when a target is
created.

INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH
--------------------------------

Removes compiler defined rpaths durimg installation.

``INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH`` is a boolean that if set to ``True`` will
remove compiler defined rpaths from the project if the user also defines rpath
with ``INSTALL_RPATH``.  This property is initialized by whether the
value of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_REMOVE_ENVIRONMENT_RPATH`` is set when a
target is created.

INSTALL_RPATH
-------------

The rpath to use for installed targets.

A semicolon-separated list specifying the rpath to use in installed
targets (for platforms that support it).  This property is initialized
by the value of the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH`` if it is set when
a target is created.

This property supports
``generator expressions``.

INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH
---------------------------

Add paths to linker search and installed rpath.

``INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH`` is a boolean that if set to ``True`` will
append directories in the linker search path and outside the project
to the ``INSTALL_RPATH``.  This property is initialized by the value of
the variable ``CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH_USE_LINK_PATH`` if it is set when a
target is created.

INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
-------------------------

List of interface options to pass to uic.

Targets may populate this property to publish the options
required to use when invoking ``uic``.  Consuming targets can add entries to their
own ``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` property such as
``$<TARGET_PROPERTY:foo,INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS>`` to use the uic options
specified in the interface of ``foo``. This is done automatically by
the ``target_link_libraries()`` command.

This property supports generator expressions.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.

INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-----------------------------


List of public compile definitions requirements for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the compile definitions
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The ``target_compile_definitions()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES
--------------------------


List of public compile features requirements for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the compile features
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The ``target_compile_features()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_FEATURES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

See the ``cmake-compile-features(7)`` manual for information on compile
features and a list of supported compilers.

INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS
-------------------------


List of public compile options requirements for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the compile options
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The ``target_compile_options()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------


List of public include directories requirements for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The ``target_include_directories()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Include directories usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

 target_include_directories(mylib INTERFACE
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/mylib>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:include/mylib>  # <prefix>/include/mylib
 )

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Note that it is not advisable to populate the ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` of the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of a target with absolute paths to the include
directories of dependencies.  That would hard-code into installed packages
the include directory paths for dependencies
**as found on the machine the package was made on**.

The ``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` of the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` is only
suitable for specifying the required include directories for headers
provided with the target itself, not those provided by the transitive
dependencies listed in its ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` target
property.  Those dependencies should themselves be targets that specify
their own header locations in ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS
----------------------

Additional public interface files on which a target binary depends for linking.

This property is supported only by ``Ninja`` and
:ref:`Makefile Generators`.
It is intended to specify dependencies on "linker scripts" for
custom Makefile link rules.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Link dependency files usage requirements commonly differ between the build-tree
and the install-tree.  The ``BUILD_INTERFACE`` and ``INSTALL_INTERFACE``
generator expressions can be used to describe separate usage requirements
based on the usage location.  Relative paths are allowed within the
``INSTALL_INTERFACE`` expression and are interpreted relative to the
installation prefix.  For example:

 set_property(TARGET mylib PROPERTY INTERFACE_LINK_DEPENDS
   $<BUILD_INTERFACE:${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/mylinkscript>
   $<INSTALL_INTERFACE:mylinkscript>  # <prefix>/mylinkscript
 )

INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------


List of public link directories requirements for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the link directories
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The ``target_link_directories()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_LINK_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES
------------------------

List public interface libraries for a library.

This property contains the list of transitive link dependencies.  When
the target is linked into another target using the
``target_link_libraries()`` command, the libraries listed (and
recursively their link interface libraries) will be provided to the
other target also.  This property is overridden by the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` or
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>`` property if policy
``CMP0022`` is ``OLD`` or unset.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::
  A call to ``target_link_libraries(<target> ...)`` may update this
  property on ``<target>``.  If ``<target>`` was not created in the same
  directory as the call then ``target_link_libraries()`` will add a
  suffix of the form ``::@<directory-id>`` to each entry, where the
  ``::@`` is a separator and the ``<directory-id>`` is unspecified.
  This tells the generators that the named libraries must be looked up in
  the scope of the caller rather than in the scope in which the
  ``<target>`` was created.  Valid directory ids are stripped on export
  by the ``install(EXPORT)`` and ``export()`` commands.

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Note that it is not advisable to populate the
``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES`` of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies **as found on the machine the package was made on**.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS
----------------------


List of public link options requirements for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the link options
required to compile against the headers for the target.  The ``target_link_options()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
build properties of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_LINK_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
-manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
----------------------------

List of interface header files to precompile into consuming targets.

Targets may populate this property to publish the header files
for consuming targets to precompile.  The ``target_precompile_headers()``
command populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
-----------------------------------

Whether consumers need to create a position-independent target

The ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property informs consumers of
this target whether they must set their
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property to ``ON``.  If this
property is set to ``ON``, then the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``
property on  all consumers will be set to ``ON``. Similarly, if this
property is set to ``OFF``, then the ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``
property on all consumers will be set to ``OFF``.  If this property is
undefined, then consumers will determine their
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property by other means.  Consumers
must ensure that the targets that they link to have a consistent
requirement for their ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.
See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual for more on defining buildsystem
properties.

INTERFACE_SOURCES
-----------------

List of interface sources to compile into consuming targets.

Targets may populate this property to publish the sources
for consuming targets to compile.  The ``target_sources()`` command
populates this property with values given to the ``PUBLIC`` and
``INTERFACE`` keywords.  Projects may also get and set the property directly.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to determine the
sources of the consumer.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_SOURCES`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------------

List of public system include directories for a library.

Targets may populate this property to publish the include directories
which contain system headers, and therefore should not result in
compiler warnings.  The ``target_include_directories(SYSTEM)``
command signature populates this property with values given to the
``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` keywords.

Projects may also get and set the property directly, but must be aware that
adding directories to this property does not make those directories used
during compilation.  Adding directories to this property marks directories
as ``SYSTEM`` which otherwise would be used in a non-``SYSTEM`` manner.  This
can appear similar to 'duplication', so prefer the
high-level ``target_include_directories(SYSTEM)`` command and avoid
setting the property by low-level means.

When target dependencies are specified using ``target_link_libraries()``,
CMake will read this property from all target dependencies to mark the
same include directories as containing system headers.

Contents of ``INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator
expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available expressions.
See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual for more on defining
buildsystem properties.

INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>
-------------------------------------

Per-configuration interprocedural optimization for a target.

This is a per-configuration version of ``INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION``.
If set, this property overrides the generic property for the named
configuration.

This property is initialized by the
``CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION_<CONFIG>`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION
----------------------------

Enable interprocedural optimization for a target.

If set to true, enables interprocedural optimizations if they are
known ``to be supported`` by the compiler. Depending
on value of policy ``CMP0069``, the error will be reported or ignored,
if interprocedural optimization is enabled but not supported.

This property is initialized by the
``CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED
--------------------

Build a combined (device and simulator) target when installing.

When this property is set to set to false (which is the default) then it will
either be built with the device SDK or the simulator SDK depending on the SDK
set. But if this property is set to true then the target will at install time
also be built for the corresponding SDK and combined into one library.

This feature requires at least Xcode version 6.

JOB_POOL_COMPILE
----------------

Ninja only: Pool used for compiling.

The number of parallel compile processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global ``JOB_POOLS``
property and then specifying here the pool name.

For instance:

 set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_COMPILE ten_jobs)

This property is initialized by the value of
``CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE``.

JOB_POOL_LINK
-------------

Ninja only: Pool used for linking.

The number of parallel link processes could be limited by defining
pools with the global ``JOB_POOLS``
property and then specifying here the pool name.

For instance:

 set_property(TARGET myexe PROPERTY JOB_POOL_LINK two_jobs)

This property is initialized by the value of ``CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK``.

LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a target.

Target label semantics are currently unspecified.

<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY
-----------------

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command
line for the ``clang-tidy`` tool.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and the ``Ninja`` generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_CLANG_TIDY`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER
------------------------

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C``, ``CXX``,
``Fortran``, or ``CUDA``.

Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for a compiler launching tool. The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the
``Ninja`` generator will run this tool and pass the compiler and
its arguments to the tool. Some example tools are distcc and ccache.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_LAUNCHER`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

<LANG>_CPPCHECK
---------------

This property is supported only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for the ``cppcheck`` static analysis tool.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and the ``Ninja`` generator will run ``cppcheck`` along with the
compiler and report any problems.  If the command-line specifies the
exit code options to ``cppcheck`` then the build  will fail if the
tool returns non-zero.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPCHECK`` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

<LANG>_CPPLINT
--------------

This property is supported only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command line
for the ``cpplint`` style checker.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the
``Ninja`` generator will run ``cpplint`` along with the compiler
and report any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_CPPLINT`` variable if it is set when a target is
created.

<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE
---------------------------

This property is implemented only when ``<LANG>`` is ``C`` or ``CXX``.

Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` containing a command
line for the ``include-what-you-use`` tool.  The :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and the ``Ninja`` generator will run this tool along with the
compiler and report a warning if the tool reports any problems.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_INCLUDE_WHAT_YOU_USE`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET
------------------------

Value for symbol visibility compile flags

The ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` property determines the value passed in a
visibility related compile option, such as ``-fvisibility=`` for ``<LANG>``.
This property affects compilation in sources of all types of targets
(subject to policy ``CMP0063``).

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for
:ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is a per-configuration version of the
``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` target property, but
multi-configuration generators (:ref:`Visual Studio Generators`,
``Xcode``) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

Contents of ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
``generator expressions``.

LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------

Output directory in which to build :ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>` target files.

This property specifies the directory into which library target files
should be built.  The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
is used.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

See also the ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` target property.

LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration output name for
:ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is the configuration-specific version of the
``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME`` target property.

LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME
-------------------

Output name for :ref:`LIBRARY <Library Output Artifacts>` target files.

This property specifies the base name for library target files.  It
overrides ``OUTPUT_NAME`` and ``OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
properties.

See also the ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`` target property.

LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED
----------------------

Do not depend on linked shared library files.

Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add
file-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this
target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient
to re-link this target.  Logical target-level dependencies will not be
affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to
date before this target is built.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_LINK_DEPENDS_NO_SHARED if it is set when a target is created.

LINK_DEPENDS
------------

Additional files on which a target binary depends for linking.

Specifies a semicolon-separated list of full-paths to files on which
the link rule for this target depends.  The target binary will be
linked if any of the named files is newer than it.

This property is supported only by ``Ninja`` and
:ref:`Makefile Generators`.  It is
intended to specify dependencies on "linker scripts" for custom Makefile link
rules.

Contents of ``LINK_DEPENDS`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

LINKER_LANGUAGE
---------------

Specifies language whose compiler will invoke the linker.

For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language
whose compiler is used to link the target (such as "C" or "CXX").  A
typical value for an executable is the language of the source file
providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language
with the highest linker preference value is the default.  See
documentation of ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE`` variables.

If this property is not set by the user, it will be calculated at
generate-time by CMake.

LINK_DIRECTORIES
----------------

List of directories to use for the link step of shared library, module
and executable targets.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories
specified so far for its target.  Use the ``target_link_directories()``
command to append more search directories.

This property is initialized by the ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` directory
property when a target is created, and is used by the generators to set
the search directories for the linker.

Contents of ``LINK_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
-------------------

Per-configuration linker flags for a ``SHARED`` library, ``MODULE`` or
``EXECUTABLE`` target.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``LINK_FLAGS``.

.. note::

  This property has been superseded by ``LINK_OPTIONS`` property.

LINK_FLAGS
----------

Additional flags to use when linking this target if it is a shared library,
module library, or an executable. Static libraries need to use
``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS`` or ``STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS``
properties.

The ``LINK_FLAGS`` property, managed as a string, can be used to add extra
flags to the link step of a target.  ``LINK_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` will add
to the configuration ``<CONFIG>``, for example, ``DEBUG``, ``RELEASE``,
``MINSIZEREL``, ``RELWITHDEBINFO``, ...

.. note::

  This property has been superseded by ``LINK_OPTIONS`` property.

LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration list of public interface libraries for a target.

This is the configuration-specific version of
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES``.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

This property is overridden by the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
property if policy ``CMP0022`` is ``NEW``.

This property is deprecated.  Use ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
instead.

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Note that it is not advisable to populate the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES_<CONFIG>`` of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies **as found on the machine the package was made on**.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES
------------------------

List public interface libraries for a shared library or executable.

By default linking to a shared library target transitively links to
targets with which the library itself was linked.  For an executable
with exports (see the ``ENABLE_EXPORTS`` target property) no
default transitive link dependencies are used.  This property replaces the default
transitive link dependencies with an explicit list.  When the target
is linked into another target using the ``target_link_libraries()``
command, the libraries listed (and recursively
their link interface libraries) will be provided to the other target
also.  If the list is empty then no transitive link dependencies will
be incorporated when this target is linked into another target even if
the default set is non-empty.  This property is initialized by the
value of the ``CMAKE_LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` variable if it is
set when a target is created.  This property is ignored for ``STATIC``
libraries.

This property is overridden by the ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
property if policy ``CMP0022`` is ``NEW``.

This property is deprecated.  Use ``INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES``
instead.

Creating Relocatable Packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


Note that it is not advisable to populate the
``LINK_INTERFACE_LIBRARIES`` of a target with absolute paths to dependencies.
That would hard-code into installed packages the library file paths
for dependencies **as found on the machine the package was made on**.

See the :ref:`Creating Relocatable Packages` section of the
``cmake-packages(7)`` manual for discussion of additional care
that must be taken when specifying usage requirements while creating
packages for redistribution.

LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY_<CONFIG>
------------------------------------

Per-configuration repetition count for cycles of ``STATIC`` libraries.

This is the configuration-specific version of
``LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY``.  If set, this property completely
overrides the generic property for the named configuration.

LINK_INTERFACE_MULTIPLICITY
---------------------------

Repetition count for ``STATIC`` libraries with cyclic dependencies.

When linking to a ``STATIC`` library target with cyclic dependencies the
linker may need to scan more than once through the archives in the
strongly connected component of the dependency graph.  CMake by
default constructs the link line so that the linker will scan through
the component at least twice.  This property specifies the minimum
number of scans if it is larger than the default.  CMake uses the
largest value specified by any target in a component.

LINK_LIBRARIES
--------------

List of direct link dependencies.

This property specifies the list of libraries or targets which will be
used for linking.  In addition to accepting values from the
``target_link_libraries()`` command, values may be set directly on
any target using the ``set_property()`` command.

The value of this property is used by the generators to set the link
libraries for the compiler.

Contents of ``LINK_LIBRARIES`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::
  A call to ``target_link_libraries(<target> ...)`` may update this
  property on ``<target>``.  If ``<target>`` was not created in the same
  directory as the call then ``target_link_libraries()`` will add a
  suffix of the form ``::@<directory-id>`` to each entry, where the
  ``::@`` is a separator and the ``<directory-id>`` is unspecified.
  This tells the generators that the named libraries must be looked up in
  the scope of the caller rather than in the scope in which the
  ``<target>`` was created.  Valid directory ids are stripped on export
  by the ``install(EXPORT)`` and ``export()`` commands.

LINK_OPTIONS
------------

List of options to use for the link step of shared library, module
and executable targets. Targets that are static libraries need to use
the ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS`` target property.


This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
specified so far for its target.  Use the ``target_link_options()``
command to append more options.

This property is initialized by the ``LINK_OPTIONS`` directory
property when a target is created, and is used by the generators to set
the options for the compiler.

Contents of ``LINK_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::

  This property must be used in preference to ``LINK_FLAGS`` property.

LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
----------------------

End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to ``-Bstatic`` regardless of how it started.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC`` if it is set
when a target is created.

See also ``LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC``.

LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
------------------------

Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be ``-Bdynamic`` at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to ``-Bstatic``.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g. with the GNU ``-static``
option).

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
 ``CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC`` if it is set
 when a target is created.

See also ``LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC``.

LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE
---------------------------

This is a boolean option that when set to ``TRUE`` will automatically run
``ldd -r -u`` on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag
``-Wl,--no-as-needed`` will be passed to the target with the link command so
that all libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the
target. This will result in the link producing a list of libraries that
provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it.
This is only applicable to executable and shared library targets and
will only work when ld and ldd accept the flags used.

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

LOCATION_<CONFIG>
-----------------

Read-only property providing a target location on disk.

A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is
located on disk for the configuration ``<CONFIG>``.  The property is
defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target
may provide a set of configurations different from that of the
importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but
otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the
``MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>`` property to map imported
configurations explicitly.

Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
``(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?``,
``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)``, or  ``LINKER_LANGUAGE``.
Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves
the location of the target undefined.

LOCATION
--------

Read-only location of a target on disk.

For an imported target, this read-only property returns the value of
the ``LOCATION_<CONFIG>`` property for an unspecified configuration
``<CONFIG>`` provided by the target.

For a non-imported target, this property is provided for compatibility
with CMake 2.4 and below.  It was meant to get the location of an
executable target's output file for use in ``add_custom_command()``.  The
path may contain a build-system-specific portion that is replaced at
build time with the configuration getting built (such as
``$(ConfigurationName)`` in VS).  In CMake 2.6 and above
``add_custom_command()`` automatically recognizes a target name in its
``COMMAND`` and ``DEPENDS`` options and computes the target location.  In
CMake 2.8.4 and above ``add_custom_command()`` recognizes
``generator expressions``
to refer to target locations anywhere in the command.
Therefore this property is not needed for creating custom commands.

Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after
reading this property.  These include properties whose names match
``(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?``,
``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)``, or "LINKER_LANGUAGE".  Failure to follow
this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target
undefined.

MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST
------------------------

Specify a custom ``Info.plist`` template for a macOS and iOS Application Bundle.

An executable target with ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` enabled will be built as an
application bundle on macOS.  By default its ``Info.plist`` file is created
by configuring a template called ``MacOSXBundleInfo.plist.in`` located in the
``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.

The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:

``MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_NAME``
  Sets ``CFBundleName``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_BUNDLE_VERSION``
  Sets ``CFBundleVersion``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_COPYRIGHT``
  Sets ``NSHumanReadableCopyright``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_GUI_IDENTIFIER``
  Sets ``CFBundleIdentifier``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_ICON_FILE``
  Sets ``CFBundleIconFile``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleGetInfoString``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_LONG_VERSION_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleLongVersionString``.
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_SHORT_VERSION_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleShortVersionString``.

CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
``Info.plist`` is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.

MACOSX_BUNDLE
-------------

Build an executable as an Application Bundle on macOS or iOS.

When this property is set to ``TRUE`` the executable when built on macOS
or iOS will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it
a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the
``MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST`` target property for information about
creation of the ``Info.plist`` file for the application bundle.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE`` if it is set when a target is created.

MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_INFO_PLIST
---------------------------

Specify a custom ``Info.plist`` template for a macOS and iOS Framework.

A library target with ``FRAMEWORK`` enabled will be built as a
framework on macOS.  By default its ``Info.plist`` file is created by
configuring a template called ``MacOSXFrameworkInfo.plist.in`` located in the
``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH``.  This property specifies an alternative template
file name which may be a full path.

The following target properties may be set to specify content to be
configured into the file:

``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_BUNDLE_VERSION``
  Sets ``CFBundleVersion``.
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_ICON_FILE``
  Sets ``CFBundleIconFile``.
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER``
  Sets ``CFBundleIdentifier``.
``MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_SHORT_VERSION_STRING``
  Sets ``CFBundleShortVersionString``.

CMake variables of the same name may be set to affect all targets in a
directory that do not have each specific property set.  If a custom
``Info.plist`` is specified by this property it may of course hard-code
all the settings instead of using the target properties.

MACOSX_RPATH
------------

Whether this target on macOS or iOS is located at runtime using rpaths.

When this property is set to ``TRUE``, the directory portion of
the ``install_name`` field of this shared library will be ``@rpath``
unless overridden by ``INSTALL_NAME_DIR``.  This indicates
the shared library is to be found at runtime using runtime
paths (rpaths).

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_MACOSX_RPATH`` if it is set when a target is
created.

Runtime paths will also be embedded in binaries using this target and
can be controlled by the ``INSTALL_RPATH`` target property on
the target linking to this target.

Policy ``CMP0042`` was introduced to change the default value of
``MACOSX_RPATH`` to ``TRUE``.  This is because use of ``@rpath`` is a
more flexible and powerful alternative to ``@executable_path`` and
``@loader_path``.

MANUALLY_ADDED_DEPENDENCIES
---------------------------

Get manually added dependencies to other top-level targets.

This read-only property can be used to query all dependencies that
were added for this target with the ``add_dependencies()``
command.

MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Map from project configuration to
:ref:`imported target <IMPORTED targets>`'s configuration.

Set this to the list of configurations of an imported target that may
be used for the current project's ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.  Targets
imported from another project may not provide the same set of
configuration names available in the current project.  Setting this
property tells CMake what imported configurations are suitable for use
when building the ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.  The first configuration in
the list found to be provided by the imported target (i.e. via
``IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>`` for the mapped-to ``<CONFIG>``)
is selected.  As a special case, an empty list element refers to the
configuration-less imported target location
(i.e. ``IMPORTED_LOCATION``).

If this property is set and no matching configurations are available,
then the imported target is considered to be not found.  This property
is ignored for non-imported targets.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>`` variable if it is set when a
target is created.

Example
^^^^^^^

For example creating imported C++ library ``foo``:

 add_library(foo STATIC IMPORTED)

Use ``foo_debug`` path for ``Debug`` build type:

 set_property(
   TARGET foo APPEND PROPERTY IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS DEBUG
   )

 set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
   IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_DEBUG "CXX"
   IMPORTED_LOCATION_DEBUG "${foo_debug}"
   )

Use ``foo_release`` path for ``Release`` build type:

 set_property(
   TARGET foo APPEND PROPERTY IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS RELEASE
   )

 set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
   IMPORTED_LINK_INTERFACE_LANGUAGES_RELEASE "CXX"
   IMPORTED_LOCATION_RELEASE "${foo_release}"
   )

Use ``Release`` version of library for ``MinSizeRel`` and ``RelWithDebInfo``
build types:

 set_target_properties(foo PROPERTIES
   MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_MINSIZEREL Release
   MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_RELWITHDEBINFO Release
   )

MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY
--------------------

Select the MSVC runtime library for use by compilers targeting the MSVC ABI.

The allowed values are:

``MultiThreaded``
  Compile with ``-MT`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  statically-linked runtime library.
``MultiThreadedDLL``
  Compile with ``-MD`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  dynamically-linked runtime library.
``MultiThreadedDebug``
  Compile with ``-MTd`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  statically-linked runtime library.
``MultiThreadedDebugDLL``
  Compile with ``-MDd`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  dynamically-linked runtime library.

The value is ignored on non-MSVC compilers but an unsupported value will
be rejected as an error when using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

The value may also be the empty string (``""``) in which case no runtime
library selection flag will be added explicitly by CMake.  Note that with
:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` the native build system may choose to
add its own default runtime library selection flag.

Use ``generator expressions`` to
support per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

 add_executable(foo foo.c)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY
   MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>")

selects for the target ``foo`` a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime
library with or without debug information depending on the configuration.

If this property is not set then CMake uses the default value
``MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>DLL`` to select a MSVC runtime library.

.. note::

  This property has effect only when policy ``CMP0091`` is set to ``NEW``
  prior to the first ``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command
  that enables a language using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

NAME
----

Logical name for the target.

Read-only logical name for the target as used by CMake.

NO_SONAME
---------

Whether to set ``soname`` when linking a shared library.

Enable this boolean property if a generated ``SHARED`` library
should not have ``soname`` set.  Default is to set ``soname`` on all
shared libraries as long as the platform supports it.
Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or
plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets
link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to
the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of
the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may
eventually fail to locate the library for the binary.

NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
-----------------------

Do not treat include directories from the interfaces of consumed
:ref:`imported targets` as ``SYSTEM``.

The contents of the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property
of imported targets are treated as ``SYSTEM`` includes by default.  If this
property is enabled on a target, compilation of sources in that target will
not treat the contents of the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` of consumed
imported targets as system includes.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED`` variable if it is set when a target
is created.

OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>
--------------------------

Per-configuration macOS and iOS binary architectures for a target.

This property is the configuration-specific version of
``OSX_ARCHITECTURES``.

OSX_ARCHITECTURES
-----------------

Target specific architectures for macOS.

The ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` property sets the target binary architecture for
targets on macOS (``-arch``).  This property is initialized by the value of the
variable ``CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` if it is set when a target is
created.  Use ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES_<CONFIG>`` to set the binary
architectures on a per-configuration basis, where ``<CONFIG>`` is an
upper-case name (e.g. ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES_DEBUG``).

OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
--------------------

Per-configuration target file base name.

This is the configuration-specific version of the ``OUTPUT_NAME``
target property.

OUTPUT_NAME
-----------

Output name for target files.

This sets the base name for output files created for an executable or
library target.  If not set, the logical target name is used by
default during generation. The value is not set by default during
configuration.

Contents of ``OUTPUT_NAME`` and the variants listed below may use
``generator expressions``.

See also the variants:

* ``OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
* ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
* ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_NAME``
* ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
* ``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_NAME``
* ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
* ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME``

PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>
-----------------

Per-configuration output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``PDB_NAME``.

.. note::
 This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
 is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file
 containing debug symbols.

 The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/pdb`` linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/Fd`` compiler flag.
 Use the ``COMPILE_PDB_NAME_<CONFIG>`` property to specify the latter.

PDB_NAME
--------

Output name for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file generated by the
linker for an executable or shared library target.

This property specifies the base name for the debug symbols file.
If not set, the ``OUTPUT_NAME`` target property value or
logical target name is used by default.

.. note::
 This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
 is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file
 containing debug symbols.

 The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/pdb`` linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/Fd`` compiler flag.
 Use the ``COMPILE_PDB_NAME`` property to specify the latter.

PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for the MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This is a per-configuration version of ``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``,
but multi-configuration generators (:ref:`Visual Studio Generators`,
``Xcode``) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` variable if it is
set when a target is created.

Contents of ``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
``generator expressions``.

.. note::
 This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
 is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file
 containing debug symbols.

 The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/pdb`` linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/Fd`` compiler flag.
 Use the ``COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` property to specify the latter.

PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------

Output directory for the MS debug symbols ``.pdb`` file
generated by the linker for an executable or shared library target.

This property specifies the directory into which the MS debug symbols
will be placed by the linker. The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
Multi-configuration generators append a per-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
is used.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` variable if it is
set when a target is created.

.. note::
 This property does not apply to STATIC library targets because no linker
 is invoked to produce them so they have no linker-generated ``.pdb`` file
 containing debug symbols.

 The linker-generated program database files are specified by the
 ``/pdb`` linker flag and are not the same as compiler-generated
 program database files specified by the ``/Fd`` compiler flag.
 Use the ``COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` property to specify the latter.

POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
-------------------------

Whether to create a position-independent target

The ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property determines whether position
independent executables or shared libraries will be created.  This
property is ``True`` by default for ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` library
targets and ``False`` otherwise.  This property is initialized by the value
of the ``CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` variable  if it is set
when a target is created.

.. note::

  For executable targets, the link step is controlled by the ``CMP0083``
  policy and the ``CheckPIESupported`` module.

PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
------------------

List of header files to precompile.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>`
of header files to precompile specified so far for its target.
Use the ``target_precompile_headers()`` command to append more header
files.

This property supports
``generator expressions``.

PRECOMPILE_HEADERS_REUSE_FROM
-----------------------------

Target from which to reuse the precompiled headers build artifact.

See the second signature of ``target_precompile_headers()`` command
for more detailed information.

PREFIX
------

What comes before the library name.

A target property that can be set to override the prefix (such as
``lib``) on a library name.

PRIVATE_HEADER
--------------

Specify private header files in a ``FRAMEWORK`` shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property generate
frameworks on macOS, iOS and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
PrivateHeaders directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple
platforms these headers may be installed using the ``PRIVATE_HEADER``
option to the ``install(TARGETS)`` command.

PROJECT_LABEL
-------------

Change the name of a target in an IDE.

Can be used to change the name of the target in an IDE like Visual
Studio.

PUBLIC_HEADER
-------------

Specify public header files in a ``FRAMEWORK`` shared library target.

Shared library targets marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property generate
frameworks on macOS, iOS and normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of header files to be placed in the
``Headers`` directory inside the framework folder.  On non-Apple platforms
these headers may be installed using the ``PUBLIC_HEADER`` option to the
``install(TARGETS)`` command.

RESOURCE
--------

Specify resource files in a ``FRAMEWORK`` or ``BUNDLE``.

Target marked with the ``FRAMEWORK`` or ``BUNDLE`` property
generate framework or application bundle (both macOS and iOS is supported)
or normal shared libraries on other platforms.
This property may be set to a list of files to be placed in the corresponding
directory (eg. ``Resources`` directory for macOS) inside the bundle.
On non-Apple platforms these files may be installed using the ``RESOURCE``
option to the ``install(TARGETS)`` command.

Following example of Application Bundle:

 add_executable(ExecutableTarget
   addDemo.c
   resourcefile.txt
   appresourcedir/appres.txt)

 target_link_libraries(ExecutableTarget heymath mul)

 set(RESOURCE_FILES
   resourcefile.txt
   appresourcedir/appres.txt)

 set_target_properties(ExecutableTarget PROPERTIES
   MACOSX_BUNDLE TRUE
   MACOSX_FRAMEWORK_IDENTIFIER org.cmake.ExecutableTarget
   RESOURCE "${RESOURCE_FILES}")

will produce flat structure for iOS systems::

 ExecutableTarget.app
   appres.txt
   ExecutableTarget
   Info.plist
   resourcefile.txt

For macOS systems it will produce following directory structure::

 ExecutableTarget.app/
   Contents
     Info.plist
     MacOS
       ExecutableTarget
     Resources
       appres.txt
       resourcefile.txt

For Linux, such CMake script produce following files::

 ExecutableTarget
 Resources
   appres.txt
   resourcefile.txt

RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE
-------------------

Specify a launcher for compile rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.

RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM
------------------

Specify a launcher for custom rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.

RULE_LAUNCH_LINK
----------------

Specify a launcher for link rules.

See the global property of the same name for details.  This overrides
the global and directory property for a target.

RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for
:ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is a per-configuration version of the
``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` target property, but
multi-configuration generators (:ref:`Visual Studio Generators`,
``Xcode``) do NOT append a
per-configuration subdirectory to the specified directory.  This
property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` variable if
it is set when a target is created.

Contents of ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` may use
``generator expressions``.

RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------

Output directory in which to build :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>` target files.

This property specifies the directory into which runtime target files
should be built.  The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
Multi-configuration generators (VS, Xcode) append a per-configuration
subdirectory to the specified directory unless a generator expression
is used.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable
CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY if it is set when a target is created.

See also the ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` target property.

RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Per-configuration output name for
:ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>` target files.

This is the configuration-specific version of the
``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME`` target property.

RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME
-------------------

Output name for :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>` target files.

This property specifies the base name for runtime target files.  It
overrides ``OUTPUT_NAME`` and ``OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>``
properties.

See also the ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_NAME_<CONFIG>`` target property.

SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
----------------

Should rpaths be used for the build tree.

``SKIP_BUILD_RPATH`` is a boolean specifying whether to skip automatic
generation of an rpath allowing the target to run from the build tree.
This property is initialized by the value of the variable
``CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH`` if it is set when a target is created.

SOURCE_DIR
----------

This read-only property reports the value of the
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` variable in the directory in which
the target was defined.

SOURCES
-------

Source names specified for a target.

List of sources specified for a target.

SOVERSION
---------

What version number is this target.

For shared libraries ``VERSION`` and ``SOVERSION`` can be used to
specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.
``SOVERSION`` is ignored if ``NO_SONAME`` property is set.

Windows Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Windows the ``VERSION``
attribute is parsed to extract a ``<major>.<minor>`` version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.

Mach-O Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Mach-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS),
the ``SOVERSION`` property corresponds to *compatibility version* and
``VERSION`` to *current version*.  See the ``FRAMEWORK`` target
property for an example.  Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the
``otool -L <binary>`` command.

STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------

Per-configuration archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library
target.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS``.

.. note::

  This property has been superseded by ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS``
  property.

STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS
--------------------

Archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library target.
Targets that are shared libraries, modules, or executables need to use
the ``LINK_OPTIONS`` or ``LINK_FLAGS`` target properties.

The ``STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS`` property, managed as a string, can be used to add
extra flags to the link step of a static library target.
``STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` will add to the configuration
``<CONFIG>``, for example, ``DEBUG``, ``RELEASE``, ``MINSIZEREL``,
``RELWITHDEBINFO``, ...

.. note::

  This property has been superseded by ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS``
  property.

STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS
----------------------

Archiver (or MSVC librarian) flags for a static library target.
Targets that are shared libraries, modules, or executables need to use
the ``LINK_OPTIONS`` target property.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
specified so far for its target.  Use ``set_target_properties()`` or
``set_property()`` commands to set its content.

Contents of ``STATIC_LIBRARY_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

.. note::

  This property must be used in preference to ``STATIC_LIBRARY_FLAGS``
  property.

SUFFIX
------

What comes after the target name.

A target property that can be set to override the suffix (such as
``.so`` or ``.exe``) on the name of a library, module or executable.

Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE
-----------------------

This property sets the path for the Swift dependency file (swiftdep) for the
target.  If one is not specified, it will default to ``<TARGET>.swiftdeps``.

Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION
----------------------

This property sets the language version for the Swift sources in the target.  If
one is not specified, it will default to ``<CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION>`` if
specified, otherwise it is the latest version supported by the compiler.

Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY
----------------------

Specify output directory for Swift modules provided by the target.

If the target contains Swift source files, this specifies the directory in which
the modules will be placed.  When this property is not set, the modules will be
placed in the build directory corresponding to the target's source directory.
If the variable ``CMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY`` is set when a target is
created its value is used to initialise this property.

Swift_MODULE_NAME
-----------------

This property specifies the name of the Swift module.  It is defaulted to the
name of the target.

TYPE
----

The type of the target.

This read-only property can be used to test the type of the given
target.  It will be one of ``STATIC_LIBRARY``, ``MODULE_LIBRARY``,
``SHARED_LIBRARY``, ``OBJECT_LIBRARY``, ``INTERFACE_LIBRARY``, ``EXECUTABLE``
or one of the internal target types.

UNITY_BUILD
-----------

Should the target source files be processed into batches for
faster compilation. This feature is known as "Unity build",
or "Jumbo build".

The ``C`` and ``CXX`` source files are grouped separately.

This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD`` variable if it is set when
a target is created.

.. note::

  It's not recommended to directly set ``UNITY_BUILD``
  to ``ON``, but to instead set ``CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD`` from
  the command line.  However, it IS recommended to set
  ``UNITY_BUILD`` to ``OFF`` if you need to ensure that a
  target doesn't get a unity build.

The batch size can be specified by setting
``UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE``.

The batching of source files is done by adding new sources files
which will ``#include`` the source files, and exclude them from
building by setting ``HEADER_FILE_ONLY`` to ``ON``.

.. note::

  Marking the original sources with ``HEADER_FILE_ONLY``
  is considered an implementation detail that may change in the
  future because it does not work well in combination with
  the ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`` variable.

ODR (One definition rule) errors
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since multiple source files are included into one source file,
it can lead to ODR errors. This section contains properties
which help fixing these errors.

The source files marked by ``GENERATED`` will be skipped
from unity build. This applies also for the source files marked
with ``SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION``.

The source files that have ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``,
``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``, ``COMPILE_FLAGS``, or
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` will also be skipped.

With the ``UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE`` and
``UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE`` one can specify code
to be injected in the unity source file before and after every
``#include`` statement.

.. note::

  The order of source files defined in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` will
  be preserved into the generated unity source files. This can
  be used to manually enforce a specific grouping based on the
  ``UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE`` target property.

UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE
----------------------

Specifies how many source code files will be included into a
``UNITY_BUILD`` source file.

If the property is not set, CMake will use the value provided
by ``CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE``.

By setting it to value `0` the generated unity source file will
contain all the source files that would otherwise be split
into multiple batches. It is not recommended to do so, since it
would affect performance.

UNITY_BUILD_CODE_AFTER_INCLUDE
------------------------------

Code snippet which is included verbatim by the ``UNITY_BUILD``
feature just after the `#include` statement of the targeted source
files.

This could be something like `#undef NOMINMAX`.

UNITY_BUILD_CODE_BEFORE_INCLUDE
-------------------------------

Code snippet which is included verbatim by the ``UNITY_BUILD``
feature just before the `#include` statement of the targeted source
files.

This could be something like `#define NOMINMAX`.

VERSION
-------

What version number is this target.

For shared libraries ``VERSION`` and ``SOVERSION`` can be used
to specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or
installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports
symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is
specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For
executables ``VERSION`` can be used to specify the build version.  When
building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the
platform supports symlinks.

Windows Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Windows the ``VERSION``
attribute is parsed to extract a ``<major>.<minor>`` version number.
These numbers are used as the image version of the binary.

Mach-O Versions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For shared libraries and executables on Mach-O systems (e.g. macOS, iOS),
the ``SOVERSION`` property correspond to *compatibility version* and
``VERSION`` to *current version*.  See the ``FRAMEWORK`` target
property for an example.  Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the
``otool -L <binary>`` command.

VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN
-------------------------

Whether to add a compile flag to hide symbols of inline functions

The ``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` property determines whether a flag for
hiding symbols for inline functions, such as ``-fvisibility-inlines-hidden``,
should be used when invoking the compiler.  This property affects compilation
in sources of all types of targets (subject to policy ``CMP0063``).

This property is initialized by
the value of the ``CMAKE_VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` variable if it
is set when a target is created.

VS_CONFIGURATION_TYPE
---------------------

Visual Studio project configuration type.

Sets the ``ConfigurationType`` attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.
The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
If this property is set, it overrides the default setting that is based on the
target type (e.g. ``StaticLibrary``, ``Application``, ...).

Supported on :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and higher.

VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND
-------------------

Sets the local debugger command for Visual Studio C++ targets.
The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
This is defined in ``<LocalDebuggerCommand>`` in the Visual Studio
project file.

This property only works for Visual Studio 2010 and above;
it is ignored on other generators.

VS_DEBUGGER_COMMAND_ARGUMENTS
-----------------------------

Sets the local debugger command line arguments for Visual Studio C++ targets.
The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
This is defined in ``<LocalDebuggerCommandArguments>`` in the Visual Studio
project file.

This property only works for Visual Studio 2010 and above;
it is ignored on other generators.

VS_DEBUGGER_ENVIRONMENT
-----------------------

Sets the local debugger environment for Visual Studio C++ targets.
The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
This is defined in ``<LocalDebuggerEnvironment>`` in the Visual Studio
project file.

This property only works for Visual Studio 2010 and above;
it is ignored on other generators.

VS_DEBUGGER_WORKING_DIRECTORY
-----------------------------

Sets the local debugger working directory for Visual Studio C++ targets.
The property value may use
``generator expressions``.
This is defined in ``<LocalDebuggerWorkingDirectory>`` in the Visual Studio
project file.

This property only works for Visual Studio 2010 and above;
it is ignored on other generators.

VS_DESKTOP_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
-----------------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 Desktop Extensions Version

Specifies the version of the Desktop Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the Desktop
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
``CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION`` variable.

VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_<refname>
-----------------------------

Visual Studio managed project .NET reference with name ``<refname>``
and hint path.

Adds one .NET reference to generated Visual Studio project. The
reference will have the name ``<refname>`` and will point to the
assembly given as value of the property.

See also ``VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES`` and
``VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL``

VS_DOTNET_REFERENCEPROP_<refname>_TAG_<tagname>
-----------------------------------------------

Defines an XML property ``<tagname>`` for a .NET reference
``<refname>``.

Reference properties can be set for .NET references which are
defined by the target properties ``VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES``,
``VS_DOTNET_REFERENCE_<refname>``
and also for project references to other C# targets which are
established by ``target_link_libraries()``.

This property is only applicable to C# targets and Visual Studio
generators 2010 and later.

VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES
--------------------

Visual Studio managed project .NET references

Adds one or more semicolon-delimited .NET references to a generated
Visual Studio project.  For example, "System;System.Windows.Forms".

VS_DOTNET_REFERENCES_COPY_LOCAL
-------------------------------

Sets the **Copy Local** property for all .NET hint references in the target

Boolean property to enable/disable copying of .NET hint references to
output directory. The default is ``ON``.

VS_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
----------------------------------

Specify the .NET target framework version.

Used to specify the .NET target framework version for C++/CLI.  For
example, "v4.5".

This property is deprecated and should not be used anymore. Use
``DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`` instead.

VS_DPI_AWARE
------------

Set the Manifest Tool -> Input and Output -> DPI Awareness in the Visual Studio
target project properties.

Valid values are ``PerMonitor``, ``ON``, or ``OFF``.

For example:

 add_executable(myproject myproject.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET myproject PROPERTY VS_DPI_AWARE "PerMonitor")

VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD
-----------------

Visual Studio project keyword for VS 10 (2010) and newer.

Sets the "keyword" attribute for a generated Visual Studio project.
Defaults to "Win32Proj".  You may wish to override this value with
"ManagedCProj", for example, in a Visual Studio managed C++ unit test
project.

Use the ``VS_KEYWORD`` target property to set the
keyword for Visual Studio 9 (2008) and older.

VS_GLOBAL_PROJECT_TYPES
-----------------------

Visual Studio project type(s).

Can be set to one or more UUIDs recognized by Visual Studio to
indicate the type of project.  This value is copied verbatim into the
generated project file.  Example for a managed C++ unit testing
project:

::

 {3AC096D0-A1C2-E12C-1390-A8335801FDAB};{8BC9CEB8-8B4A-11D0-8D11-00A0C91BC942}

UUIDs are semicolon-delimited.

VS_GLOBAL_ROOTNAMESPACE
-----------------------

Visual Studio project root namespace.

Sets the "RootNamespace" attribute for a generated Visual Studio
project.  The attribute will be generated only if this is set.

VS_GLOBAL_<variable>
--------------------

Visual Studio project-specific global variable.

Tell the Visual Studio generator to set the global variable
'<variable>' to a given value in the generated Visual Studio project.
Ignored on other generators.  Qt integration works better if
VS_GLOBAL_QtVersion is set to the version FindQt4.cmake found.  For
example, "4.7.3"

VS_IOT_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
-------------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 IoT Extensions Version

Specifies the version of the IoT Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the IoT
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
``CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION`` variable.

VS_IOT_STARTUP_TASK
-------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 IoT Continuous Background Task

Specifies that the target should be compiled as a Continuous Background Task library.

VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING
-------------------------

Enable Just My Code with Visual Studio debugger.

Supported on :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and higher,
:ref:`Makefile Generators` and the ``Ninja`` generators.

This property is initialized by the ``CMAKE_VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING``
variable if it is set when a target is created.

VS_KEYWORD
----------

Visual Studio project keyword for VS 9 (2008) and older.

Can be set to change the visual studio keyword, for example Qt
integration works better if this is set to Qt4VSv1.0.

Use the ``VS_GLOBAL_KEYWORD`` target property to set the
keyword for Visual Studio 10 (2010) and newer.

VS_MOBILE_EXTENSIONS_VERSION
----------------------------

Visual Studio Windows 10 Mobile Extensions Version

Specifies the version of the Mobile Extensions that should be included in the
target. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the Mobile
Extensions will not be included. To use the same version of the extensions as
the Windows 10 SDK that is being used, you can use the
``CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION`` variable.

VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY
---------------------

Specify that the target should not be marked for deployment to a Windows CE
or Windows Phone device in the generated Visual Studio solution.

Be default, all EXE and shared library (DLL) targets are marked to deploy to
the target device in the generated Visual Studio solution.

Generator expressions are supported.

There are reasons one might want to exclude a target / generated project from
deployment:

- The library or executable may not be necessary in the primary deploy/debug
  scenario, and excluding from deployment saves time in the
  develop/download/debug cycle.
- There may be insufficient space on the target device to accommodate all of
  the build products.
- Visual Studio 2013 requires a target device IP address be entered for each
  target marked for deployment.  For large numbers of targets, this can be
  tedious.
  NOTE: Visual Studio *will* deploy all project dependencies of a project
  tagged for deployment to the IP address configured for that project even
  if those dependencies are not tagged for deployment.


Example 1
^^^^^^^^^

This shows setting the variable for the target foo.

 add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY ON)

Example 2
^^^^^^^^^

This shows setting the variable for the Release configuration only.

 add_library(foo SHARED foo.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET foo PROPERTY VS_NO_SOLUTION_DEPLOY "$<CONFIG:Release>")

VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES
---------------------

Visual Studio package references for nuget.

Adds one or more semicolon-delimited package references to a generated
Visual Studio project. The version of the package will be
underscore delimited. For example, ``boost_1.7.0;nunit_3.12.*``.

 set_property(TARGET ${TARGET_NAME} PROPERTY
   VS_PACKAGE_REFERENCES "boost_1.7.0")

VS_PROJECT_IMPORT
-----------------

Visual Studio managed project imports

Adds to a generated Visual Studio project one or more semicolon-delimited paths
to .props files needed when building projects from some NuGet packages.
For example, ``my_packages_path/MyPackage.1.0.0/build/MyPackage.props``.

VS_SCC_AUXPATH
--------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Aux Path.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control auxpath
property.

VS_SCC_LOCALPATH
----------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Local Path.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control local path
property.

VS_SCC_PROJECTNAME
------------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Project.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control project
name property.

VS_SCC_PROVIDER
---------------

Visual Studio Source Code Control Provider.

Can be set to change the visual studio source code control provider
property.

VS_SDK_REFERENCES
-----------------

Visual Studio project SDK references.
Specify a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of SDK references
to be added to a generated Visual Studio project, e.g.
``Microsoft.AdMediatorWindows81, Version=1.0``.

VS_USER_PROPS
-------------

Sets the user props file to be included in the visual studio
C++ project file. The standard path is
``$(UserRootDir)\\Microsoft.Cpp.$(Platform).user.props``, which is
in most cases the same as
``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\v4.0\\Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user.props``
or ``%LOCALAPPDATA%\\Microsoft\\MSBuild\\v4.0\\Microsoft.Cpp.x64.user.props``.

The ``*.user.props`` files can be used for Visual Studio wide
configuration which is independent from cmake.

VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_MIN_VERSION
--------------------------------------

Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Minimum Version

For Windows 10. Specifies the minimum version of the OS that is being
targeted. For example ``10.0.10240.0``. If the value is not specified, the
value of ``CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION`` will be used on
WindowsStore projects otherwise the target platform minimum version will not
be specified for the project.

VS_WINRT_COMPONENT
------------------

Mark a target as a Windows Runtime component for the Visual Studio generator.
Compile the target with ``C++/CX`` language extensions for Windows Runtime.
For ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` libraries, this also defines the
``_WINRT_DLL`` preprocessor macro.

.. note::
  Currently this is implemented only by Visual Studio generators.
  Support may be added to other generators in the future.

VS_WINRT_EXTENSIONS
-------------------

Deprecated.  Use ``VS_WINRT_COMPONENT`` instead.
This property was an experimental partial implementation of that one.

VS_WINRT_REFERENCES
-------------------

Visual Studio project Windows Runtime Metadata references

Adds one or more semicolon-delimited WinRT references to a generated
Visual Studio project.  For example, "Windows;Windows.UI.Core".

WIN32_EXECUTABLE
----------------

Build an executable with a WinMain entry point on windows.

When this property is set to true the executable when linked on
Windows will be created with a WinMain() entry point instead of just
main().  This makes it a GUI executable instead of a console application.
See the ``CMAKE_MFC_FLAG`` variable documentation to
configure use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) for WinMain
executables.  This property is initialized by the value of the
``CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE`` variable if it is set when
a target is created.

WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS
--------------------------

This property is implemented only for MS-compatible tools on Windows.

Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition
(``.def``) file with all global symbols found in the input ``.obj`` files
for a ``SHARED`` library (or executable with ``ENABLE_EXPORTS``)
on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker
causing all symbols to be exported from the ``.dll``.
For global *data* symbols, ``__declspec(dllimport)`` must still be used when
compiling against the code in the ``.dll``.  All other function symbols will
be automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting
projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit ``dllexport`` markup,
even in ``C++`` classes.

When this property is enabled, zero or more ``.def`` files may also be
specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files
will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a
single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be
used to export symbols from a ``.dll`` that are not in any of its object
files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. ``msvcrt.lib``).

This property is initialized by the value of
the ``CMAKE_WINDOWS_EXPORT_ALL_SYMBOLS`` variable if it is set
when a target is created.

XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>
------------------------------

Set Xcode target attributes directly.

Tell the ``Xcode`` generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given
value in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

See the ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>`` variable
to set attributes on all targets in a directory tree.

Contents of ``XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available
expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
------------------------

Set the Xcode ``explicitFileType`` attribute on its reference to a
target.  CMake computes a default based on target type but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also ``XCODE_PRODUCT_TYPE``.

XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME
---------------------

If enabled, the ``Xcode`` generator will generate schema files.  These
are useful to invoke analyze, archive, build-for-testing and test
actions from the command line.

This property is initialized by the value of the variable

XCTEST
------

This target is a XCTest CFBundle on the Mac.

This property will usually get set via the ``xctest_add_bundle()``
macro in ``FindXCTest`` module.

If a module library target has this property set to true it will be
built as a CFBundle when built on the Mac.  It will have the directory
structure required for a CFBundle.

This property depends on ``BUNDLE`` to be effective.

Properties on Tests
===================

ATTACHED_FILES_ON_FAIL
----------------------

Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission if the test fails.

Same as ``ATTACHED_FILES``, but these files will only be
included if the test does not pass.

ATTACHED_FILES
--------------

Attach a list of files to a dashboard submission.

Set this property to a list of files that will be encoded and
submitted to the dashboard as an addition to the test result.

COST
----

This property describes the cost of a test.  When parallel testing is
enabled, tests in the test set will be run in descending order of cost.
Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this property
to a floating point value.

When the cost of a test is not defined by the project,
``ctest`` will initially use a default cost of ``0``.
It computes a weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and
uses that as an improved estimate of the cost for the next run.  The more
a test is re-run in the same build directory, the more representative the
cost should become.

DEPENDS
-------

Specifies that this test should only be run after the specified list of tests.

Set this to a list of tests that must finish before this test is run. The
results of those tests are not considered, the dependency relationship is
purely for order of execution (i.e. it is really just a *run after*
relationship). Consider using test fixtures with setup tests if a dependency
with successful completion is required (see ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED``).

DISABLED
--------

If set to ``True``, the test will be skipped and its status will be 'Not Run'. A
``DISABLED`` test will not be counted in the total number of tests and its
completion status will be reported to CDash as ``Disabled``.

A ``DISABLED`` test does not participate in test fixture dependency resolution.
If a ``DISABLED`` test has fixture requirements defined in its
``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property, it will not cause setup or cleanup
tests for those fixtures to be added to the test set.

If a test with the ``FIXTURES_SETUP`` property set is ``DISABLED``,
the fixture behavior will be as though that setup test was passing and any test
case requiring that fixture will still run.

ENVIRONMENT
-----------

Specify environment variables that should be defined for running a test.

If set to a list of environment variables and values of the form
``MYVAR=value`` those environment variables will be defined while running
the test.  The environment is restored to its previous state after the
test is done.

FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
-----------------------

If the output matches this regular expression the test will fail.

If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will fail.  Example:

 set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
   FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a-z]Error;ERROR;Failed"
 )

``FAIL_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` expects a list of regular expressions.

FIXTURES_CLEANUP
----------------

Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a cleanup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.

Fixture cleanup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP`` property for a test has two
primary effects:

- CTest will ensure the test executes after all other tests which list any of
  the fixtures in its ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property.

- If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
  expressions or the ``--rerun-failed`` option) and the cleanup test is not in
  the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
  set require any fixture listed in ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP``.

A cleanup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP``
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one cleanup test defined. If there
are multiple cleanup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with
the usual ``DEPENDS`` test property if necessary.

A cleanup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its ``FIXTURES_CLEANUP`` property. For example:

 # Ok: Dependent fixture is different to cleanup
 set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
   FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
   FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
 )

 # Error: cannot require same fixture as cleanup
 set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES
   FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo
   FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
 )

Cleanup tests will execute even if setup or regular tests for that fixture fail
or are skipped.

See ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.

FIXTURES_REQUIRED
-----------------

Specifies a list of fixtures the test requires. Fixture names are case
sensitive and they are not required to have any similarity to test names.

Fixtures are a way to attach setup and cleanup tasks to a set of tests. If a
test requires a given fixture, then all tests marked as setup tasks for that
fixture will be executed first (once for the whole set of tests, not once per
test requiring the fixture). After all tests requiring a particular fixture
have completed, CTest will ensure all tests marked as cleanup tasks for that
fixture are then executed. Tests are marked as setup tasks with the
``FIXTURES_SETUP`` property and as cleanup tasks with the
``FIXTURES_CLEANUP`` property. If any of a fixture's setup tests fail,
all tests listing that fixture in their ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property will not
be executed. The cleanup tests for the fixture will always be executed, even if
some setup tests fail.

When CTest is asked to execute only a subset of tests (e.g. by the use of
regular expressions or when run with the ``--rerun-failed`` command line
option), it will automatically add any setup or cleanup tests for fixtures
required by any of the tests that are in the execution set. This behavior can
be overridden with the ``-FS``, ``-FC`` and ``-FA`` command line options to
``ctest(1)`` if desired.

Since setup and cleanup tasks are also tests, they can have an ordering
specified by the ``DEPENDS`` test property just like any other tests.
This can be exploited to implement setup or cleanup using multiple tests for a
single fixture to modularise setup or cleanup logic.

The concept of a fixture is different to that of a resource specified by
``RESOURCE_LOCK``, but they may be used together. A fixture defines a
set of tests which share setup and cleanup requirements, whereas a resource
lock has the effect of ensuring a particular set of tests do not run in
parallel. Some situations may need both, such as setting up a database,
serialising test access to that database and deleting the database again at the
end. For such cases, tests would populate both ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` and
``RESOURCE_LOCK`` to combine the two behaviours. Names used for
``RESOURCE_LOCK`` have no relationship with names of fixtures, so note
that a resource lock does not imply a fixture and vice versa.

Consider the following example which represents a database test scenario
similar to that mentioned above:

 add_test(NAME testsDone   COMMAND emailResults)
 add_test(NAME fooOnly     COMMAND testFoo)
 add_test(NAME dbOnly      COMMAND testDb)
 add_test(NAME dbWithFoo   COMMAND testDbWithFoo)
 add_test(NAME createDB    COMMAND initDB)
 add_test(NAME setupUsers  COMMAND userCreation)
 add_test(NAME cleanupDB   COMMAND deleteDB)
 add_test(NAME cleanupFoo  COMMAND removeFoos)

 set_tests_properties(setupUsers PROPERTIES DEPENDS createDB)

 set_tests_properties(createDB   PROPERTIES FIXTURES_SETUP    DB)
 set_tests_properties(setupUsers PROPERTIES FIXTURES_SETUP    DB)
 set_tests_properties(cleanupDB  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  DB)
 set_tests_properties(cleanupFoo PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  Foo)
 set_tests_properties(testsDone  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_CLEANUP  "DB;Foo")

 set_tests_properties(fooOnly    PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo)
 set_tests_properties(dbOnly     PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED DB)
 set_tests_properties(dbWithFoo  PROPERTIES FIXTURES_REQUIRED "DB;Foo")

 set_tests_properties(dbOnly dbWithFoo createDB setupUsers cleanupDB
                      PROPERTIES RESOURCE_LOCK DbAccess)

Key points from this example:

- Two fixtures are defined: ``DB`` and ``Foo``. Tests can require a single
  fixture as ``fooOnly`` and ``dbOnly`` do, or they can depend on multiple
  fixtures like ``dbWithFoo`` does.

- A ``DEPENDS`` relationship is set up to ensure ``setupUsers`` happens after
  ``createDB``, both of which are setup tests for the ``DB`` fixture and will
  therefore be executed before the ``dbOnly`` and ``dbWithFoo`` tests
  automatically.

- No explicit ``DEPENDS`` relationships were needed to make the setup tests run
  before or the cleanup tests run after the regular tests.

- The ``Foo`` fixture has no setup tests defined, only a single cleanup test.

- ``testsDone`` is a cleanup test for both the ``DB`` and ``Foo`` fixtures.
  Therefore, it will only execute once regular tests for both fixtures have
  finished (i.e. after ``fooOnly``, ``dbOnly`` and ``dbWithFoo``). No
  ``DEPENDS`` relationship was specified for ``testsDone``, so it is free to
  run before, after or concurrently with other cleanup tests for either
  fixture.

- The setup and cleanup tests never list the fixtures they are for in their own
  ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property, as that would result in a dependency on
  themselves and be considered an error.

FIXTURES_SETUP
--------------

Specifies a list of fixtures for which the test is to be treated as a setup
test. These fixture names are distinct from test case names and are not
required to have any similarity to the names of tests associated with them.

Fixture setup tests are ordinary tests with all of the usual test
functionality. Setting the ``FIXTURES_SETUP`` property for a test has two
primary effects:

- CTest will ensure the test executes before any other test which lists the
  fixture name(s) in its ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property.

- If CTest is asked to run only a subset of tests (e.g. using regular
  expressions or the ``--rerun-failed`` option) and the setup test is not in
  the set of tests to run, it will automatically be added if any tests in the
  set require any fixture listed in ``FIXTURES_SETUP``.

A setup test can have multiple fixtures listed in its ``FIXTURES_SETUP``
property. It will execute only once for the whole CTest run, not once for each
fixture. A fixture can also have more than one setup test defined. If there are
multiple setup tests for a fixture, projects can control their order with the
usual ``DEPENDS`` test property if necessary.

A setup test is allowed to require other fixtures, but not any fixture listed
in its ``FIXTURES_SETUP`` property. For example:

 # Ok: dependent fixture is different to setup
 set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
   FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
   FIXTURES_REQUIRED Bar
 )

 # Error: cannot require same fixture as setup
 set_tests_properties(setupFoo PROPERTIES
   FIXTURES_SETUP    Foo
   FIXTURES_REQUIRED Foo
 )

If any of a fixture's setup tests fail, none of the tests listing that fixture
in its ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` property will be run. Cleanup tests will,
however, still be executed.

See ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` for a more complete discussion of how to use
test fixtures.

LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a test.

The list is reported in dashboard submissions.

MEASUREMENT
-----------

Specify a ``CDASH`` measurement and value to be reported for a test.

If set to a name then that name will be reported to ``CDASH`` as a named
measurement with a value of ``1``.  You may also specify a value by
setting ``MEASUREMENT`` to ``measurement=value``.

PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
-----------------------

The output must match this regular expression for the test to pass.

If set, the test output will be checked against the specified regular
expressions and at least one of the regular expressions has to match,
otherwise the test will fail.  Example:

 set_tests_properties(mytest PROPERTIES
   PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "TestPassed;All ok"
 )

``PASS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` expects a list of regular expressions.

PROCESSES
----------

Set to specify the number of processes spawned by a test, and the resources
that they require. See :ref:`hardware allocation <ctest-hardware-allocation>`
for more information on how this property integrates into the CTest hardware
allocation feature.

The ``PROCESSES`` property is a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language
Lists>` of process descriptions. Each process description consists of an
optional number of processes for the description followed by a series of
resource requirements for those processes. These requirements (and the number
of processes) are separated by commas. The resource requirements consist of the
name of a resource type, followed by a colon, followed by an unsigned integer
specifying the number of slots required on one resource of the given type.

Please note that these processes are not spawned by CTest. The ``PROCESSES``
property merely tells CTest what processes the test expects to launch. It is up
to the test itself to do this process spawning, and read the :ref:`environment
variables <ctest-hardware-environment-variables>` to determine which resources
each process has been allocated.

Consider the following example:

 add_test(NAME MyTest COMMAND MyExe)
 set_property(TEST MyTest PROPERTY PROCESSES
   "2,gpus:2"
   "gpus:4,crypto_chips:2")

In this example, there are two process descriptions (implicitly separated by a
semicolon.) The content of the first description is ``2,gpus:2``. This
description spawns 2 processes, each of which requires 2 slots from a single
GPU. The content of the second description is ``gpus:4,crypto_chips:2``. This
description does not specify a process count, so a default of 1 is assumed.
This single process requires 4 slots from a single GPU and 2 slots from a
single cryptography chip. In total, 3 processes are spawned from this test,
each with their own unique requirements.

When CTest sets the :ref:`environment variables
<ctest-hardware-environment-variables>` for a test, it assigns a process number
based on the process description, starting at 0 on the left and the number of
processes minus 1 on the right. For example, in the example above, the two
processes in the first description would have IDs of 0 and 1, and the single
process in the second description would have an ID of 2.

Both the ``PROCESSES`` and ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` properties serve similar
purposes, but they are distinct and orthogonal. Resources specified by
``PROCESSES`` do not affect ``RESOURCE_LOCK``, and vice versa. Whereas
``RESOURCE_LOCK`` is a simpler property that is used for locking one
global resource, ``PROCESSES`` is a more advanced property that allows multiple
tests to simultaneously use multiple resources of the same type, specifying
their requirements in a fine-grained manner.

PROCESSOR_AFFINITY
------------------

Set to a true value to ask CTest to launch the test process with CPU affinity
for a fixed set of processors.  If enabled and supported for the current
platform, CTest will choose a set of processors to place in the CPU affinity
mask when launching the test process.  The number of processors in the set is
determined by the ``PROCESSORS`` test property or the number of
processors available to CTest, whichever is smaller.  The set of processors
chosen will be disjoint from the processors assigned to other concurrently
running tests that also have the ``PROCESSOR_AFFINITY`` property enabled.

PROCESSORS
----------

Set to specify how many process slots this test requires.
If not set, the default is ``1`` processor.

Denotes the number of processors that this test will require.  This is
typically used for MPI tests, and should be used in conjunction with
the ``ctest_test()`` ``PARALLEL_LEVEL`` option.

This will also be used to display a weighted test timing result in label and
subproject summaries in the command line output of ``ctest(1)``. The wall
clock time for the test run will be multiplied by this property to give a
better idea of how much cpu resource CTest allocated for the test.

See also the ``PROCESSOR_AFFINITY`` test property.

REQUIRED_FILES
--------------

List of files required to run the test.

If set to a list of files, the test will not be run unless all of the
files exist.

RESOURCE_LOCK
-------------

Specify a list of resources that are locked by this test.

If multiple tests specify the same resource lock, they are guaranteed
not to run concurrently.

See also ``FIXTURES_REQUIRED`` if the resource requires any setup or
cleanup steps.

Both the ``PROCESSES`` and ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` properties serve similar
purposes, but they are distinct and orthogonal. Resources specified by
``PROCESSES`` do not affect ``RESOURCE_LOCK``, and vice versa. Whereas
``RESOURCE_LOCK`` is a simpler property that is used for locking one global
resource, ``PROCESSES`` is a more advanced property that allows
multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources of the same type,
specifying their requirements in a fine-grained manner.

RUN_SERIAL
----------

Do not run this test in parallel with any other test.

Use this option in conjunction with the ctest_test ``PARALLEL_LEVEL``
option to specify that this test should not be run in parallel with
any other tests.

SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION
-----------------------

If the output matches this regular expression the test will be marked as skipped.

If set, if the output matches one of specified regular expressions,
the test will be marked as skipped.  Example:

 set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY
   SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION "[^a-z]Skip" "SKIP" "Skipped"
 )

``SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` expects a list of regular expressions.

See also the ``SKIP_RETURN_CODE`` property.

SKIP_RETURN_CODE
----------------

Return code to mark a test as skipped.

Sometimes only a test itself can determine if all requirements for the
test are met. If such a situation should not be considered a hard failure
a return code of the process can be specified that will mark the test as
``Not Run`` if it is encountered. Valid values are in the range of
0 to 255, inclusive.

See also the ``SKIP_REGULAR_EXPRESSION`` property.

TIMEOUT
-------

How many seconds to allow for this test.

This property if set will limit a test to not take more than the
specified number of seconds to run.  If it exceeds that the test
process will be killed and ctest will move to the next test.  This
setting takes precedence over ``CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT``.

TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH
-------------------

Change a test's timeout duration after a matching line is encountered
in its output.

Usage
^^^^^

 add_test(mytest ...)
 set_property(TEST mytest PROPERTY TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH "${seconds}" "${regex}")

Description
^^^^^^^^^^^

Allow a test ``seconds`` to complete after ``regex`` is encountered in
its output.

When the test outputs a line that matches ``regex`` its start time is
reset to the current time and its timeout duration is changed to
``seconds``.  Prior to this, the timeout duration is determined by the
``TIMEOUT`` property or the ``CTEST_TEST_TIMEOUT``
variable if either of these are set.  Because the test's start time is
reset, its execution time will not include any time that was spent
waiting for the matching output.

``TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH`` is useful for avoiding spurious
timeouts when your test must wait for some system resource to become
available before it can execute.  Set ``TIMEOUT`` to a longer
duration that accounts for resource acquisition and use
``TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH`` to control how long the actual test
is allowed to run.

If the required resource can be controlled by CTest you should use
``RESOURCE_LOCK`` instead of ``TIMEOUT_AFTER_MATCH``.
This property should be used when only the test itself can determine
when its required resources are available.

WILL_FAIL
---------

If set to true, this will invert the pass/fail flag of the test.

This property can be used for tests that are expected to fail and
return a non zero return code.

WORKING_DIRECTORY
-----------------

The directory from which the test executable will be called.

If this is not set, the test will be run with the working directory set to the
binary directory associated with where the test was created (i.e. the
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` for where ``add_test()`` was
called).

Properties on Source Files
==========================

ABSTRACT
--------

Is this source file an abstract class.

A property on a source file that indicates if the source file
represents a class that is abstract.  This only makes sense for
languages that have a notion of an abstract class and it is only used
by some tools that wrap classes into other languages.

AUTOUIC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``uic`` when using ``AUTOUIC``

This property holds additional command line options
which will be used when ``uic`` is executed during the build via
``AUTOUIC``, i.e. it is equivalent to the optional ``OPTIONS``
argument of the ``qt4_wrap_ui()`` macro.

By default it is empty.

The options set on the ``.ui`` source file may override
``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` set on the target.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE widget.ui PROPERTY AUTOUIC_OPTIONS "--no-protection")
 # ...

AUTORCC_OPTIONS
---------------

Additional options for ``rcc`` when using ``AUTORCC``

This property holds additional command line options which will be used when
``rcc`` is executed during the build via ``AUTORCC``, i.e. it is equivalent to the
optional ``OPTIONS`` argument of the ``qt4_add_resources()`` macro.

By default it is empty.

The options set on the ``.qrc`` source file may override
``AUTORCC_OPTIONS`` set on the target.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE resources.qrc PROPERTY AUTORCC_OPTIONS "--compress;9")
 # ...

COMPILE_DEFINITIONS
-------------------

Preprocessor definitions for compiling a source file.

The ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` property may be set to a semicolon-separated
list of preprocessor definitions using the syntax ``VAR`` or ``VAR=value``.
Function-style definitions are not supported.  CMake will
automatically escape the value correctly for the native build system
(note that CMake language syntax may require escapes to specify some
values).  This property may be set on a per-configuration basis using
the name ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` where ``<CONFIG>`` is an upper-case
name (ex.  ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG``).

CMake will automatically drop some definitions that are not supported
by the native build tool.  Xcode does not support per-configuration
definitions on source files.

Disclaimer: Most native build tools have poor support for escaping
certain values.  CMake has work-arounds for many cases but some values
may just not be possible to pass correctly.  If a value does not seem
to be escaped correctly, do not attempt to work-around the problem by
adding escape sequences to the value.  Your work-around may break in a
future version of CMake that has improved escape support.  Instead
consider defining the macro in a (configured) header file.  Then
report the limitation.  Known limitations include::

 #          - broken almost everywhere
 ;          - broken in VS IDE 7.0 and Borland Makefiles
 ,          - broken in VS IDE
 %          - broken in some cases in NMake
 & |        - broken in some cases on MinGW
 ^ < > \"   - broken in most Make tools on Windows

CMake does not reject these values outright because they do work in
some cases.  Use with caution.

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` may use ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  However, ``Xcode``
does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions
that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that
generator.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting the alternative per-configuration
property.

COMPILE_FLAGS
-------------

Additional flags to be added when compiling this source file.

The ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` property, managed as a string, sets additional compiler
flags used to build source files.  Use ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` to pass
additional preprocessor definitions.

Contents of ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  However, ``Xcode``
does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions
that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that
generator.

.. note::

  This property has been superseded by the ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` property.

COMPILE_OPTIONS
---------------

List of additional options to pass to the compiler.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of options
and will be added to the list of compile flags when this
source file builds.  Use ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` to pass
additional preprocessor definitions and ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` to pass
additional include directories.

Contents of ``COMPILE_OPTIONS`` may use "generator expressions" with the
syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  However, ``Xcode``
does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions
that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that
generator.

.. note::

  This property should be preferred over the ``COMPILE_FLAGS`` property.

EXTERNAL_OBJECT
---------------

If set to true then this is an object file.

If this property is set to ``True`` then the source file is really an
object file and should not be compiled.  It will still be linked into
the target though.

Fortran_FORMAT
--------------

Set to ``FIXED`` or ``FREE`` to indicate the Fortran source layout.

This property tells CMake whether a given Fortran source file uses
fixed-format or free-format.  CMake will pass the corresponding format
flag to the compiler.  Consider using the target-wide
``Fortran_FORMAT`` property if all source files in a target
share the same format.

GENERATED
---------

Is this source file generated as part of the build or CMake process.

Tells the internal CMake engine that a source file is generated by an outside
process such as another build step, or the execution of CMake itself. This
information is then used to exempt the file from any existence or validity
checks. Generated files are created by the execution of commands such as
``add_custom_command()`` and ``file(GENERATE)``.

When a generated file created by an ``add_custom_command()`` command
is explicitly listed as a source file for any target in the same
directory scope (which usually means the same ``CMakeLists.txt`` file),
CMake will automatically create a dependency to make sure the file is
generated before building that target.

Generated sources may be hidden in some IDE tools, while in others they might
be shown. For the special case of sources generated by CMake's ``AUTOMOC``
or ``AUTORCC`` functionality, the ``AUTOGEN_SOURCE_GROUP``,
``AUTOMOC_SOURCE_GROUP`` and ``AUTORCC_SOURCE_GROUP`` target
properties may influence where the generated sources are grouped in the project's
file lists.

HEADER_FILE_ONLY
----------------

Is this source file only a header file.

A property on a source file that indicates if the source file is a
header file with no associated implementation.  This is set
automatically based on the file extension and is used by CMake to
determine if certain dependency information should be computed.

By setting this property to ``ON``, you can disable compilation of
the given source file, even if it should be compiled because it is
part of the library's/executable's sources.

This is useful if you have some source files which you somehow
pre-process, and then add these pre-processed sources via
``add_library()`` or ``add_executable()``. Normally, in IDE,
there would be no reference of the original sources, only of these
pre-processed sources. So by setting this property for all the original
source files to ``ON``, and then either calling ``add_library()``
or ``add_executable()`` while passing both the pre-processed
sources and the original sources, or by using ``target_sources()``
to add original source files will do exactly what would one expect, i.e.
the original source files would be visible in IDE, and will not be built.

INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-------------------

List of preprocessor include file search directories.

This property holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of paths
and will be added to the list of include directories when this
source file builds. These directories will take precedence over directories
defined at target level except for ``Xcode`` generator due to technical
limitations.

Relative paths should not be added to this property directly.

Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use "generator expressions" with
the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual
for available expressions.  However, ``Xcode`` does not support
per-config per-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build
configuration are not allowed with that generator.

KEEP_EXTENSION
--------------

Make the output file have the same extension as the source file.

If this property is set then the file extension of the output file
will be the same as that of the source file.  Normally the output file
extension is computed based on the language of the source file, for
example ``.cxx`` will go to a ``.o`` extension.

LABELS
------

Specify a list of text labels associated with a source file.

This property has meaning only when the source file is listed in a
target whose ``LABELS`` property is also set.  No other semantics are
currently specified.

LANGUAGE
--------

What programming language is the file.

A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the
source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on
the file extension.  Typical values are ``CXX`` (i.e.  C++), ``C``,
``CSharp``, ``CUDA``, ``Fortran``, and ``ASM``.  Setting this
property for a file means this file will be compiled.  Do not set this
for headers or files that should not be compiled.

LOCATION
--------

The full path to a source file.

A read only property on a SOURCE FILE that contains the full path to
the source file.

MACOSX_PACKAGE_LOCATION
-----------------------

Place a source file inside a Application Bundle
(``MACOSX_BUNDLE``), Core Foundation Bundle (``BUNDLE``),
or Framework Bundle (``FRAMEWORK``).  It is applicable for macOS
and iOS.

Executable targets with the ``MACOSX_BUNDLE`` property set are
built as macOS or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared
library targets with the ``FRAMEWORK`` property set are built as
macOS or iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with
the ``BUNDLE`` property set are built as macOS ``CFBundle`` bundles
on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property
set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content
folder specified by the property value.  For macOS Application Bundles the
content folder is ``<name>.app/Contents``.  For macOS Frameworks the
content folder is ``<name>.framework/Versions/<version>``.  For macOS
CFBundles the content folder is ``<name>.bundle/Contents`` (unless the
extension is changed).  See the ``PUBLIC_HEADER``,
``PRIVATE_HEADER``, and ``RESOURCE`` target properties for
specifying files meant for ``Headers``, ``PrivateHeaders``, or
``Resources`` directories.

If the specified location is equal to ``Resources``, the resulting location
will be the same as if the ``RESOURCE`` property had been used. If
the specified location is a sub-folder of ``Resources``, it will be placed
into the respective sub-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout
where no ``Resources`` folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the ``Resources``
folder name from the specified location.

OBJECT_DEPENDS
--------------

Additional files on which a compiled object file depends.

Specifies a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of full-paths to
files on which any object files compiled from this source file depend.
On :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the ``Ninja`` generator an
object file will be recompiled if any of the named files is newer than it.
:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and the ``Xcode`` generator
cannot implement such compilation dependencies.

This property need not be used to specify the dependency of a source
file on a generated header file that it includes.  Although the
property was originally introduced for this purpose, it is no longer
necessary.  If the generated header file is created by a custom
command in the same target as the source file, the automatic
dependency scanning process will recognize the dependency.  If the
generated header file is created by another target, an inter-target
dependency should be created with the ``add_dependencies()``
command (if one does not already exist due to linking relationships).

OBJECT_OUTPUTS
--------------

Additional outputs for a ``Ninja`` or :ref:`Makefile Generators` rule.

Additional outputs created by compilation of this source file.  If any
of these outputs is missing the object will be recompiled.  This is
supported only on the ``Ninja`` and :ref:`Makefile Generators`
and will be ignored on other generators.

SKIP_AUTOGEN
------------

Exclude the source file from ``AUTOMOC``, ``AUTOUIC`` and
``AUTORCC`` processing (for Qt projects).

For finer exclusion control see ``SKIP_AUTOMOC``,
``SKIP_AUTOUIC`` and ``SKIP_AUTORCC``.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOGEN ON)
 # ...

SKIP_AUTOMOC
------------

Exclude the source file from ``AUTOMOC`` processing (for Qt projects).

For broader exclusion control see ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOMOC ON)
 # ...

SKIP_AUTORCC
------------

Exclude the source file from ``AUTORCC`` processing (for Qt projects).

For broader exclusion control see ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE file.qrc PROPERTY SKIP_AUTORCC ON)
 # ...

SKIP_AUTOUIC
------------

Exclude the source file from ``AUTOUIC`` processing (for Qt projects).

``SKIP_AUTOUIC`` can be set on C++ header and source files and on
``.ui`` files.

For broader exclusion control see ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

EXAMPLE
^^^^^^^

 # ...
 set_property(SOURCE file.h PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
 set_property(SOURCE file.cpp PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
 set_property(SOURCE widget.ui PROPERTY SKIP_AUTOUIC ON)
 # ...

SKIP_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS
-----------------------

Is this source file skipped by ``PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` feature.

This property helps with build problems that one would run into
when using the ``PRECOMPILE_HEADERS`` feature.

One example would be the usage of Objective-C (*.m) files, and
Objective-C++ (*.mm) files, which lead to compilation failure
because they are treated (in case of Ninja / Makefile generator)
as C, and CXX respectively. The precompile headers are not
compatible between languages.

SKIP_UNITY_BUILD_INCLUSION
--------------------------

Is this source file skipped by ``UNITY_BUILD`` feature.

This property helps with "ODR (One definition rule)" problems
that one would run into when using an ``UNITY_BUILD``.

Swift_DEPENDENCIES_FILE
-----------------------

This property sets the path for the Swift dependency file (swiftdeps) for the
source.  If one is not specified, it will default to ``<OBJECT>.swiftdeps``.

Swift_DIAGNOSTICS_FILE
----------------------

This property controls where the Swift diagnostics are serialized.

SYMBOLIC
--------

Is this just a name for a rule.

If ``SYMBOLIC`` (boolean) is set to ``True`` the build system will be informed
that the source file is not actually created on disk but instead used
as a symbolic name for a build rule.

VS_COPY_TO_OUT_DIR
------------------

Sets the ``<CopyToOutputDirectory>`` tag for a source file in a
Visual Studio project file. Valid values are ``Never``, ``Always``
and ``PreserveNewest``.

VS_CSHARP_<tagname>
-------------------

Visual Studio and CSharp source-file-specific configuration.

Tell the ``Visual Studio generators``
to set the source file tag ``<tagname>``
to a given value in the generated Visual Studio CSharp
project. Ignored on other generators and languages. This property
can be used to define dependencies between source files or set any
other Visual Studio specific parameters.

Example usage:

 set_source_files_property(<filename>
          PROPERTIES
          VS_CSHARP_DependentUpon <other file>
          VS_CSHARP_SubType "Form")

VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT
---------------------

Mark a source file as content for deployment with a Windows Phone or
Windows Store application when built with a
``Visual Studio generators``.
The value must evaluate to either ``1`` or ``0`` and may use
``generator expressions``
to make the choice based on the build configuration.
The ``.vcxproj`` file entry for the source file will be
marked either ``DeploymentContent`` or ``ExcludedFromBuild``
for values ``1`` and ``0``, respectively.

VS_DEPLOYMENT_LOCATION
----------------------

Specifies the deployment location for a content source file with a Windows
Phone or Windows Store application when built
with a ``Visual Studio generators``.
This property is only applicable when using ``VS_DEPLOYMENT_CONTENT``.
The value represent the path relative to the app package and applies to all
configurations.

VS_INCLUDE_IN_VSIX
------------------

Boolean property to specify if the file should be included within a
VSIX (Visual Studio Integration Extension) extension package.
This is needed for development of Visual Studio extensions.

VS_RESOURCE_GENERATOR
---------------------

This property allows to specify the resource generator to be used
on this file. It defaults to ``PublicResXFileCodeGenerator`` if
not set.

This property only applies to C# projects.

VS_SHADER_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATIONS
-------------------------------

Disable compiler optimizations for an ``.hlsl`` source file.  This adds the
``-Od`` flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value
``true`` for this property to disable compiler optimizations.

VS_SHADER_ENABLE_DEBUG
----------------------

Enable debugging information for an ``.hlsl`` source file.  This adds the
``-Zi`` flag to the command line for the FxCompiler tool.  Specify the value
``true`` to generate debugging information for the compiled shader.

VS_SHADER_ENTRYPOINT
--------------------

Specifies the name of the entry point for the shader of a ``.hlsl`` source
file.

VS_SHADER_FLAGS
---------------

Set additional Visual Studio shader flags of a ``.hlsl`` source file.

VS_SHADER_MODEL
---------------

Specifies the shader model of a ``.hlsl`` source file. Some shader types can
only be used with recent shader models

VS_SHADER_OBJECT_FILE_NAME
--------------------------

Specifies a file name for the compiled shader object file for an ``.hlsl``
source file.  This adds the ``-Fo`` flag to the command line for the FxCompiler
tool.

VS_SHADER_OUTPUT_HEADER_FILE
----------------------------

Set filename for output header file containing object code of a ``.hlsl``
source file.

VS_SHADER_TYPE
--------------

Set the Visual Studio shader type of a ``.hlsl`` source file.

VS_SHADER_VARIABLE_NAME
-----------------------

Set name of variable in header file containing object code of a ``.hlsl``
source file.

VS_XAML_TYPE
------------

Mark a Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) source file
as a different type than the default ``Page``.
The most common usage would be to set the default ``App.xaml`` file as
``ApplicationDefinition``.

WRAP_EXCLUDE
------------

Exclude this source file from any code wrapping techniques.

Some packages can wrap source files into alternate languages to
provide additional functionality.

For example, C++ code can be wrapped into Java or Python, using SWIG.
If ``WRAP_EXCLUDE`` is set to ``True``, that indicates that this
source file should not be wrapped.

XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE
------------------------

Set the ``Xcode`` ``explicitFileType`` attribute on its reference to a
source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also ``XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE``.

XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES
---------------------

Add values to the ``Xcode`` ``ATTRIBUTES`` setting on its reference to a
source file.  Among other things, this can be used to set the role on
a ``.mig`` file::

 set_source_files_properties(defs.mig
     PROPERTIES
         XCODE_FILE_ATTRIBUTES "Client;Server"
 )

XCODE_LAST_KNOWN_FILE_TYPE
--------------------------

Set the ``Xcode`` ``lastKnownFileType`` attribute on its reference to
a source file.  CMake computes a default based on file extension but
can be told explicitly with this property.

See also ``XCODE_EXPLICIT_FILE_TYPE``, which is preferred
over this property if set.

Properties on Cache Entries
===========================

ADVANCED
--------

True if entry should be hidden by default in GUIs.

This is a boolean value indicating whether the entry is considered
interesting only for advanced configuration.  The ``mark_as_advanced()``
command modifies this property.

HELPSTRING
----------

Help associated with entry in GUIs.

This string summarizes the purpose of an entry to help users set it
through a CMake GUI.

MODIFIED
--------

Internal management property.  Do not set or get.

This is an internal cache entry property managed by CMake to track
interactive user modification of entries.  Ignore it.

STRINGS
-------

Enumerate possible ``STRING`` entry values for GUI selection.

For cache entries with type ``STRING``, this enumerates a set of values.
CMake GUIs may use this to provide a selection widget instead of a
generic string entry field.  This is for convenience only.  CMake does
not enforce that the value matches one of those listed.

TYPE
----

Widget type for entry in GUIs.

Cache entry values are always strings, but CMake GUIs present widgets
to help users set values.  The GUIs use this property as a hint to
determine the widget type.  Valid ``TYPE`` values are:

::

 BOOL          = Boolean ON/OFF value.
 PATH          = Path to a directory.
 FILEPATH      = Path to a file.
 STRING        = Generic string value.
 INTERNAL      = Do not present in GUI at all.
 STATIC        = Value managed by CMake, do not change.
 UNINITIALIZED = Type not yet specified.

Generally the ``TYPE`` of a cache entry should be set by the command which
creates it ( ``set()``, ``option()``, ``find_library()``, etc.).

VALUE
-----

Value of a cache entry.

This property maps to the actual value of a cache entry.  Setting this
property always sets the value without checking, so use with care.

Properties on Installed Files
=============================

Deprecated Properties on Directories
====================================

ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES
---------------------------

Additional files to remove during the clean stage.

A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of files that will be removed as a
part of the ``make clean`` target.

Arguments to ``ADDITIONAL_MAKE_CLEAN_FILES`` may use
``generator expressions``.

This property only works for the Makefile generators.
It is ignored on other generators.

COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Ignored.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0043``.

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions in a directory.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
where ``<CONFIG>`` is an upper-case name (ex. ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG``).

This property will be initialized in each directory by its value in
the directory's parent.

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting this property.

TEST_INCLUDE_FILE
-----------------

Deprecated.  Use ``TEST_INCLUDE_FILES`` instead.

A cmake file that will be included when ctest is run.

If you specify ``TEST_INCLUDE_FILE``, that file will be included and
processed when ctest is run on the directory.

Deprecated Properties on Targets
================================

COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Ignored.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0043``.

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a target.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
where ``<CONFIG>`` is an upper-case name (ex. ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_DEBUG``).

Contents of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>`` may use "generator expressions"
with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the ``cmake-generator-expressions(7)``
manual for available expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)``
manual for more on defining buildsystem properties.

Generator expressions should be preferred instead of setting this property.

POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT
-------------------

Deprecated install support.

The ``PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` and ``POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` properties are
the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
target.  They are used only when the old ``INSTALL_TARGETS`` command is
used to install the target.  Use the ``install()`` command instead.

PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT
------------------

Deprecated install support.

The ``PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` and ``POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT`` properties are
the old way to specify CMake scripts to run before and after installing a
target.  They are used only when the old ``INSTALL_TARGETS`` command is
used to install the target.  Use the ``install()`` command instead.

Deprecated Properties on Source Files
=====================================

COMPILE_DEFINITIONS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------

Ignored.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0043``.

Per-configuration preprocessor definitions on a source file.

This is the configuration-specific version of ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``.
Note that ``Xcode`` does not support per-configuration source
file flags so this property will be ignored by the ``Xcode`` generator.

cmake-qt(7)
***********

Introduction
============

CMake can find and use Qt 4 and Qt 5 libraries.  The Qt 4 libraries are found
by the ``FindQt4`` find-module shipped with CMake, whereas the
Qt 5 libraries are found using "Config-file Packages" shipped with Qt 5. See
``cmake-packages(7)`` for more information about CMake packages, and
see the Qt cmake manual
for your Qt version.

Qt 4 and Qt 5 may be used together in the same
``CMake buildsystem``:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8.0 FATAL_ERROR)

 project(Qt4And5)

 set(CMAKE_AUTOMOC ON)

 find_package(Qt5 COMPONENTS Widgets DBus REQUIRED)
 add_executable(publisher publisher.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(publisher Qt5::Widgets Qt5::DBus)

 find_package(Qt4 REQUIRED)
 add_executable(subscriber subscriber.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(subscriber Qt4::QtGui Qt4::QtDBus)

A CMake target may not link to both Qt 4 and Qt 5.  A diagnostic is issued if
this is attempted or results from transitive target dependency evaluation.

Qt Build Tools
==============

Qt relies on some bundled tools for code generation, such as ``moc`` for
meta-object code generation, ``uic`` for widget layout and population,
and ``rcc`` for virtual file system content generation.  These tools may be
automatically invoked by ``cmake(1)`` if the appropriate conditions
are met.  The automatic tool invocation may be used with both Qt 4 and Qt 5.

AUTOMOC
^^^^^^^

The ``AUTOMOC`` target property controls whether ``cmake(1)``
inspects the C++ files in the target to determine if they require ``moc`` to
be run, and to create rules to execute ``moc`` at the appropriate time.

If a macro from ``AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES`` is found in a header file,
``moc`` will be run on the file.  The result will be put into a file named
according to ``moc_<basename>.cpp``.
If the macro is found in a C++ implementation
file, the moc output will be put into a file named according to
``<basename>.moc``, following the Qt conventions.  The ``<basename>.moc`` must
be included by the user in the C++ implementation file with a preprocessor
``#include``.

Included ``moc_*.cpp`` and ``*.moc`` files will be generated in the
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include`` directory which is
automatically added to the target's ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

* This differs from CMake 3.7 and below; see their documentation for details.

* For ``multi configuration generators``,
  the include directory is ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``.

* See ``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR``.

Not included ``moc_<basename>.cpp`` files will be generated in custom
folders to avoid name collisions and included in a separate
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/mocs_compilation.cpp`` file which is compiled
into the target.

* See ``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR``.

The ``moc`` command line will consume the ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS`` and
``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target properties from the target it is being
invoked for, and for the appropriate build configuration.

The ``AUTOMOC`` target property may be pre-set for all
following targets by setting the ``CMAKE_AUTOMOC`` variable.  The
``AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS`` target property may be populated to set
options to pass to ``moc``. The ``CMAKE_AUTOMOC_MOC_OPTIONS``
variable may be populated to pre-set the options for all following targets.

Additional macro names to search for can be added to
``AUTOMOC_MACRO_NAMES``.

Additional ``moc`` dependency file names can be extracted from source code
by using ``AUTOMOC_DEPEND_FILTERS``.

Source C++ files can be excluded from ``AUTOMOC`` processing by
enabling ``SKIP_AUTOMOC`` or the broader ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

AUTOUIC
^^^^^^^

The ``AUTOUIC`` target property controls whether ``cmake(1)``
inspects the C++ files in the target to determine if they require ``uic`` to
be run, and to create rules to execute ``uic`` at the appropriate time.

If a preprocessor ``#include`` directive is found which matches
``<path>ui_<basename>.h``, and a ``<basename>.ui`` file exists,
then ``uic`` will be executed to generate the appropriate file.
The ``<basename>.ui`` file is searched for in the following places

1. ``<source_dir>/<basename>.ui``
2. ``<source_dir>/<path><basename>.ui``
3. ``<AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS>/<basename>.ui``
4. ``<AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS>/<path><basename>.ui``

where ``<source_dir>`` is the directory of the C++ file and
``AUTOUIC_SEARCH_PATHS`` is a list of additional search paths.

The generated generated ``ui_*.h`` files are placed in the
``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include`` directory which is
automatically added to the target's ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

* This differs from CMake 3.7 and below; see their documentation for details.

* For ``multi configuration generators``,
  the include directory is ``<AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR>/include_<CONFIG>``.

* See ``AUTOGEN_BUILD_DIR``.

The ``AUTOUIC`` target property may be pre-set for all following
targets by setting the ``CMAKE_AUTOUIC`` variable.  The
``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` target property may be populated to set options
to pass to ``uic``.  The ``CMAKE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` variable may be
populated to pre-set the options for all following targets.  The
``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` source file property may be set on the
``<basename>.ui`` file to set particular options for the file.  This
overrides options from the ``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` target property.

A target may populate the ``INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` target
property with options that should be used when invoking ``uic``.  This must be
consistent with the ``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS`` target property content of the
depender target.  The ``CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES`` variable may
be used to track the origin target of such
``INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS``.  This means that a library which
provides an alternative translation system for Qt may specify options which
should be used when running ``uic``:

 add_library(KI18n klocalizedstring.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(KI18n Qt5::Core)

 # KI18n uses the tr2i18n() function instead of tr().  That function is
 # declared in the klocalizedstring.h header.
 set(autouic_options
   -tr tr2i18n
   -include klocalizedstring.h
 )

 set_property(TARGET KI18n APPEND PROPERTY
   INTERFACE_AUTOUIC_OPTIONS ${autouic_options}
 )

A consuming project linking to the target exported from upstream automatically
uses appropriate options when ``uic`` is run by ``AUTOUIC``, as a
result of linking with the ``IMPORTED`` target:

 set(CMAKE_AUTOUIC ON)
 # Uses a libwidget.ui file:
 add_library(LibWidget libwidget.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(LibWidget
   KF5::KI18n
   Qt5::Widgets
 )

Source files can be excluded from ``AUTOUIC`` processing by
enabling ``SKIP_AUTOUIC`` or the broader ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

AUTORCC
^^^^^^^

The ``AUTORCC`` target property controls whether ``cmake(1)``
creates rules to execute ``rcc`` at the appropriate time on source files
which have the suffix ``.qrc``.

 add_executable(myexe main.cpp resource_file.qrc)

The ``AUTORCC`` target property may be pre-set for all following targets
by setting the ``CMAKE_AUTORCC`` variable.  The
``AUTORCC_OPTIONS`` target property may be populated to set options
to pass to ``rcc``.  The ``CMAKE_AUTORCC_OPTIONS`` variable may be
populated to pre-set the options for all following targets.  The
``AUTORCC_OPTIONS`` source file property may be set on the
``<name>.qrc`` file to set particular options for the file.  This
overrides options from the ``AUTORCC_OPTIONS`` target property.

Source files can be excluded from ``AUTORCC`` processing by
enabling ``SKIP_AUTORCC`` or the broader ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``.

The ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` target
===============================

The ``moc`` and ``uic`` tools are executed as part of a synthesized
``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` ``custom target`` generated by
CMake.  By default that ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` target inherits the dependencies
of the ``<ORIGIN>`` target (see ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS``).
Target dependencies may be added to the ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` target by adding
them to the ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`` target property.

Visual Studio Generators
========================

When using the ``Visual Studio generators``, CMake
generates a ``PRE_BUILD`` ``custom command``
instead of the ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` ``custom target``
(for ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC``).
This isn't always possible though and
an ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` ``custom target`` is used,
when either

- the ``<ORIGIN>`` target depends on ``GENERATED`` files which aren't
  excluded from ``AUTOMOC`` and ``AUTOUIC`` by
  ``SKIP_AUTOMOC``, ``SKIP_AUTOUIC``, ``SKIP_AUTOGEN``
  or ``CMP0071``
- ``AUTOGEN_TARGET_DEPENDS`` lists a source file
- ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET`` is enabled

qtmain.lib on Windows
=====================

The Qt 4 and 5 ``IMPORTED`` targets for the QtGui libraries specify
that the qtmain.lib static library shipped with Qt will be linked by all
dependent executables which have the ``WIN32_EXECUTABLE`` enabled.

To disable this behavior, enable the ``Qt5_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` target property for
Qt 5 based targets or ``QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN`` target property for Qt 4 based
targets.

 add_executable(myexe WIN32 main.cpp)
 target_link_libraries(myexe Qt4::QtGui)

 add_executable(myexe_no_qtmain WIN32 main_no_qtmain.cpp)
 set_property(TARGET main_no_qtmain PROPERTY QT4_NO_LINK_QTMAIN ON)
 target_link_libraries(main_no_qtmain Qt4::QtGui)

cmake-server(7)
***************

Introduction
============

``cmake(1)`` is capable of providing semantic information about
CMake code it executes to generate a buildsystem.  If executed with
the ``-E server`` command line options, it starts in a long running mode
and allows a client to request the available information via a JSON protocol.

The protocol is designed to be useful to IDEs, refactoring tools, and
other tools which have a need to understand the buildsystem in entirety.

A single ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` may describe buildsystem contents
and build properties which differ based on
``generation-time context``
including:

* The Platform (eg, Windows, APPLE, Linux).
* The build configuration (eg, Debug, Release, Coverage).
* The Compiler (eg, MSVC, GCC, Clang) and compiler version.
* The language of the source files compiled.
* Available compile features (eg CXX variadic templates).
* CMake policies.

The protocol aims to provide information to tooling to satisfy several
needs:

#. Provide a complete and easily parsed source of all information relevant
   to the tooling as it relates to the source code.  There should be no need
   for tooling to parse generated buildsystems to access include directories
   or compile definitions for example.
#. Semantic information about the CMake buildsystem itself.
#. Provide a stable interface for reading the information in the CMake cache.
#. Information for determining when cmake needs to be re-run as a result of
   file changes.


Operation
=========

Start ``cmake(1)`` in the server command mode, supplying the path to
the build directory to process::

 cmake -E server (--debug|--pipe=<NAMED_PIPE>)

The server will communicate using stdin/stdout (with the ``--debug`` parameter)
or using a named pipe (with the ``--pipe=<NAMED_PIPE>`` parameter).  Note
that "named pipe" refers to a local domain socket on Unix and to a named pipe
on Windows.

When connecting to the server (via named pipe or by starting it in ``--debug``
mode), the server will reply with a hello message::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"supportedProtocolVersions":[{"major":1,"minor":0}],"type":"hello"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Messages sent to and from the process are wrapped in magic strings::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   ... some JSON message ...
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

The server is now ready to accept further requests via the named pipe
or stdin.


Debugging
=========

CMake server mode can be asked to provide statistics on execution times, etc.
or to dump a copy of the response into a file. This is done passing a "debug"
JSON object as a child of the request.

The debug object supports the "showStats" key, which takes a boolean and makes
the server mode return a "zzzDebug" object with stats as part of its response.
"dumpToFile" takes a string value and will cause the cmake server to copy
the response into the given filename.

This is a response from the cmake server with "showStats" set to true::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "cookie":"",
   "errorMessage":"Waiting for type \"handshake\".",
   "inReplyTo":"unknown",
  "type":"error",
   "zzzDebug": {
     "dumpFile":"/tmp/error.txt",
     "jsonSerialization":0.011016,
     "size":111,
     "totalTime":0.025995
   }
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

The server has made a copy of this response into the file /tmp/error.txt and
took 0.011 seconds to turn the JSON response into a string, and it took 0.025
seconds to process the request in total. The reply has a size of 111 bytes.


Protocol API
============


General Message Layout
----------------------

All messages need to have a "type" value, which identifies the type of
message that is passed back or forth. E.g. the initial message sent by the
server is of type "hello". Messages without a type will generate an response
of type "error".

All requests sent to the server may contain a "cookie" value. This value
will he handed back unchanged in all responses triggered by the request.

All responses will contain a value "inReplyTo", which may be empty in
case of parse errors, but will contain the type of the request message
in all other cases.


Type "reply"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is used by the server to reply to requests.

The message may -- depending on the type of the original request --
contain values.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"zimtstern","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"reply"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "error"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

This type is used to return an error condition to the client. It will
contain an "errorMessage".

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"","errorMessage":"Protocol version not supported.","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"error"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "progress"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the server is busy for a long time, it is polite to send back replies of
type "progress" to the client. These will contain a "progressMessage" with a
string describing the action currently taking place as well as
"progressMinimum", "progressMaximum" and "progressCurrent" with integer values
describing the range of progress.

Messages of type "progress" will be followed by more "progress" messages or with
a message of type "reply" or "error" that complete the request.

"progress" messages may not be emitted after the "reply" or "error" message for
the request that triggered the responses was delivered.


Type "message"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A message is triggered when the server processes a request and produces some
form of output that should be displayed to the user. A Message has a "message"
with the actual text to display as well as a "title" with a suggested dialog
box title.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"","message":"Something happened.","title":"Title Text","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"message"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "signal"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server can send signals when it detects changes in the system state. Signals
are of type "signal", have an empty "cookie" and "inReplyTo" field and always
have a "name" set to show which signal was sent.


Specific Signals
----------------

The cmake server may sent signals with the following names:

"dirty" Signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "dirty" signal is sent whenever the server determines that the configuration
of the project is no longer up-to-date. This happens when any of the files that have
an influence on the build system is changed.

The "dirty" signal may look like this::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "cookie":"",
   "inReplyTo":"",
   "name":"dirty",
   "type":"signal"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

"fileChange" Signal
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "fileChange" signal is sent whenever a watched file is changed. It contains
the "path" that has changed and a list of "properties" with the kind of change
that was detected. Possible changes are "change" and "rename".

The "fileChange" signal looks like this::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "cookie":"",
   "inReplyTo":"",
   "name":"fileChange",
   "path":"/absolute/CMakeLists.txt",
   "properties":["change"],
   "type":"signal"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Specific Message Types
----------------------


Type "hello"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The initial message send by the cmake server on startup is of type "hello".
This is the only message ever sent by the server that is not of type "reply",
"progress" or "error".

It will contain "supportedProtocolVersions" with an array of server protocol
versions supported by the cmake server. These are JSON objects with "major" and
"minor" keys containing non-negative integer values. Some versions may be marked
as experimental. These will contain the "isExperimental" key set to true. Enabling
these requires a special command line argument when starting the cmake server mode.

Within a "major" version all "minor" versions are fully backwards compatible.
New "minor" versions may introduce functionality in such a way that existing
clients of the same "major" version will continue to work, provided they
ignore keys in the output that they do not know about.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"supportedProtocolVersions":[{"major":0,"minor":1}],"type":"hello"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "handshake"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The first request that the client may send to the server is of type "handshake".

This request needs to pass one of the "supportedProtocolVersions" of the "hello"
type response received earlier back to the server in the "protocolVersion" field.
Giving the "major" version of the requested protocol version will make the server
use the latest minor version of that protocol. Use this if you do not explicitly
need to depend on a specific minor version.

Protocol version 1.0 requires the following attributes to be set:

  * "sourceDirectory" with a path to the sources
  * "buildDirectory" with a path to the build directory
  * "generator" with the generator name
  * "extraGenerator" (optional!) with the extra generator to be used
  * "platform" with the generator platform (if supported by the generator)
  * "toolset" with the generator toolset (if supported by the generator)

Protocol version 1.2 makes all but the build directory optional, provided
there is a valid cache in the build directory that contains all the other
information already.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"zimtstern","type":"handshake","protocolVersion":{"major":0},
  "sourceDirectory":"/home/code/cmake", "buildDirectory":"/tmp/testbuild",
  "generator":"Ninja"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

which will result in a response type "reply"::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"zimtstern","inReplyTo":"handshake","type":"reply"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

indicating that the server is ready for action.


Type "globalSettings"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request can be sent after the initial handshake. It will return a
JSON structure with information on cmake state.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"globalSettings"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

which will result in a response type "reply"::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "buildDirectory": "/tmp/test-build",
   "capabilities": {
     "generators": [
       {
         "extraGenerators": [],
         "name": "Watcom WMake",
         "platformSupport": false,
         "toolsetSupport": false
       },
       <...>
     ],
     "serverMode": false,
     "version": {
       "isDirty": false,
       "major": 3,
       "minor": 6,
       "patch": 20160830,
       "string": "3.6.20160830-gd6abad",
       "suffix": "gd6abad"
     }
   },
   "checkSystemVars": false,
   "cookie": "",
   "extraGenerator": "",
   "generator": "Ninja",
   "debugOutput": false,
   "inReplyTo": "globalSettings",
   "sourceDirectory": "/home/code/cmake",
   "trace": false,
   "traceExpand": false,
   "type": "reply",
   "warnUninitialized": false,
   "warnUnused": false,
   "warnUnusedCli": true
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "setGlobalSettings"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request can be sent to change the global settings attributes. Unknown
attributes are going to be ignored. Read-only attributes reported by
"globalSettings" are all capabilities, buildDirectory, generator,
extraGenerator and sourceDirectory. Any attempt to set these will be ignored,
too.

All other settings will be changed.

The server will respond with an empty reply message or an error.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"setGlobalSettings","debugOutput":true}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply to this with::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"inReplyTo":"setGlobalSettings","type":"reply"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "configure"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request will configure a project for build.

To configure a build directory already containing cmake files, it is enough to
set "buildDirectory" via "setGlobalSettings". To create a fresh build directory
you also need to set "currentGenerator" and "sourceDirectory" via "setGlobalSettings"
in addition to "buildDirectory".

You may a list of strings to "configure" via the "cacheArguments" key. These
strings will be interpreted similar to command line arguments related to
cache handling that are passed to the cmake command line client.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"configure", "cacheArguments":["-Dsomething=else"]}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply like this (after reporting progress for some time)::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"","inReplyTo":"configure","type":"reply"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "compute"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This request will generate build system files in the build directory and
is only available after a project was successfully "configure"d.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"compute"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply (after reporting progress information)::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"cookie":"","inReplyTo":"compute","type":"reply"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "codemodel"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "codemodel" request can be used after a project was "compute"d successfully.

It will list the complete project structure as it is known to cmake.

The reply will contain a key "configurations", which will contain a list of
configuration objects. Configuration objects are used to destinquish between
different configurations the build directory might have enabled. While most
generators only support one configuration, others might support several.

Each configuration object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the name of the configuration. The name may be empty.
"projects"
  contains a list of project objects, one for each build project.

Project objects define one (sub-)project defined in the cmake build system.

Each project object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the (sub-)projects name.
"minimumCMakeVersion"
  contains the minimum cmake version allowed for this project, null if the
  project doesn't specify one.
"hasInstallRule"
  true if the project contains any install rules, false otherwise.
"sourceDirectory"
  contains the current source directory
"buildDirectory"
  contains the current build directory.
"targets"
  contains a list of build system target objects.

Target objects define individual build targets for a certain configuration.

Each target object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the name of the target.
"type"
  defines the type of build of the target. Possible values are
  "STATIC_LIBRARY", "MODULE_LIBRARY", "SHARED_LIBRARY", "OBJECT_LIBRARY",
  "EXECUTABLE", "UTILITY" and "INTERFACE_LIBRARY".
"fullName"
  contains the full name of the build result (incl. extensions, etc.).
"sourceDirectory"
  contains the current source directory.
"buildDirectory"
  contains the current build directory.
"isGeneratorProvided"
  true if the target is auto-created by a generator, false otherwise
"hasInstallRule"
  true if the target contains any install rules, false otherwise.
"installPaths"
  full path to the destination directories defined by target install rules.
"artifacts"
  with a list of build artifacts. The list is sorted with the most
  important artifacts first (e.g. a .DLL file is listed before a
  .PDB file on windows).
"linkerLanguage"
  contains the language of the linker used to produce the artifact.
"linkLibraries"
  with a list of libraries to link to. This value is encoded in the
  system's native shell format.
"linkFlags"
  with a list of flags to pass to the linker. This value is encoded in
  the system's native shell format.
"linkLanguageFlags"
  with the flags for a compiler using the linkerLanguage. This value is
  encoded in the system's native shell format.
"frameworkPath"
  with the framework path (on Apple computers). This value is encoded
  in the system's native shell format.
"linkPath"
  with the link path. This value is encoded in the system's native shell
  format.
"sysroot"
  with the sysroot path.
"fileGroups"
  contains the source files making up the target.

FileGroups are used to group sources using similar settings together.

Each fileGroup object may contain the following keys:

"language"
  contains the programming language used by all files in the group.
"compileFlags"
  with a string containing all the flags passed to the compiler
  when building any of the files in this group. This value is encoded in
  the system's native shell format.
"includePath"
  with a list of include paths. Each include path is an object
  containing a "path" with the actual include path and "isSystem" with a bool
  value informing whether this is a normal include or a system include. This
  value is encoded in the system's native shell format.
"defines"
  with a list of defines in the form "SOMEVALUE" or "SOMEVALUE=42". This
  value is encoded in the system's native shell format.
"sources"
  with a list of source files.

All file paths in the fileGroup are either absolute or relative to the
sourceDirectory of the target.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"codemodel"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "configurations": [
     {
       "name": "",
       "projects": [
         {

                   "includePath": [ { "path": "/tmp/build/Utilities" }, <...> ],
                   "isGenerated": false,
                   "language": "C",
                   "sources": [ "fld_arg.c", <...> ]
                 }
               ],
               "fullName": "libcmForm.a",
               "linkerLanguage": "C",
               "name": "cmForm",

               "type": "STATIC_LIBRARY"
             }
           ]
         },
         <...>
       ]
     }
   ],
   "cookie": "",
   "inReplyTo": "codemodel",
   "type": "reply"
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

Type "ctestInfo"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "ctestInfo" request can be used after a project was "compute"d successfully.

It will list the complete project test structure as it is known to cmake.

The reply will contain a key "configurations", which will contain a list of
configuration objects. Configuration objects are used to destinquish between
different configurations the build directory might have enabled. While most
generators only support one configuration, others might support several.

Each configuration object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the name of the configuration. The name may be empty.
"projects"
  contains a list of project objects, one for each build project.

Project objects define one (sub-)project defined in the cmake build system.

Each project object can have the following keys:

"name"
  contains the (sub-)projects name.
"ctestInfo"
  contains a list of test objects.

Each test object can have the following keys:

"ctestName"
  contains the name of the test.
"ctestCommand"
  contains the test command.
"properties"
  contains a list of test property objects.

Each test property object can have the following keys:

"key"
  contains the test property key.
"value"
  contains the test property value.


Type "cmakeInputs"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "cmakeInputs" requests will report files used by CMake as part
of the build system itself.

This request is only available after a project was successfully
"configure"d.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"cmakeInputs"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will reply with the following information::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"buildFiles":
   [
     {"isCMake":true,"isTemporary":false,"sources":["/usr/lib/cmake/...", ... ]},
     {"isCMake":false,"isTemporary":false,"sources":["CMakeLists.txt", ...]},
     {"isCMake":false,"isTemporary":true,"sources":["/tmp/build/CMakeFiles/...", ...]}
   ],
   "cmakeRootDirectory":"/usr/lib/cmake",
   "sourceDirectory":"/home/code/src/cmake",
   "cookie":"",
   "inReplyTo":"cmakeInputs",
   "type":"reply"
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

All file names are either relative to the top level source directory or
absolute.

The list of files which "isCMake" set to true are part of the cmake installation.

The list of files witch "isTemporary" set to true are part of the build directory
and will not survive the build directory getting cleaned out.


Type "cache"
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "cache" request will list the cached configuration values.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"cache"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will respond with the following output::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "cookie":"","inReplyTo":"cache","type":"reply",
   "cache":
   [
     {
       "key":"SOMEVALUE",
       "properties":
       {
         "ADVANCED":"1",
         "HELPSTRING":"This is not helpful"
       }
       "type":"STRING",
       "value":"TEST"}
   ]
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

The output can be limited to a list of keys by passing an array of key names
to the "keys" optional field of the "cache" request.


Type "fileSystemWatchers"
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The server can watch the filesystem for changes. The "fileSystemWatchers"
command will report on the files and directories watched.

Example::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {"type":"fileSystemWatchers"}
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

CMake will respond with the following output::

 [== "CMake Server" ==[
 {
   "cookie":"","inReplyTo":"fileSystemWatchers","type":"reply",
   "watchedFiles": [ "/absolute/path" ],
   "watchedDirectories": [ "/absolute" ]
 }
 ]== "CMake Server" ==]

cmake-toolchains(7)
*******************

Introduction
============

CMake uses a toolchain of utilities to compile, link libraries and create
archives, and other tasks to drive the build. The toolchain utilities available
are determined by the languages enabled. In normal builds, CMake automatically
determines the toolchain for host builds based on system introspection and
defaults. In cross-compiling scenarios, a toolchain file may be specified
with information about compiler and utility paths.

Languages
=========

Languages are enabled by the ``project()`` command.  Language-specific
built-in variables, such as
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER``,
``CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_ID`` etc are set by
invoking the ``project()`` command.  If no project command
is in the top-level CMakeLists file, one will be implicitly generated. By default
the enabled languages are ``C`` and ``CXX``:

 project(C_Only C)

A special value of ``NONE`` can also be used with the ``project()`` command
to enable no languages:

 project(MyProject NONE)

The ``enable_language()`` command can be used to enable languages after the
``project()`` command:

 enable_language(CXX)

When a language is enabled, CMake finds a compiler for that language, and
determines some information, such as the vendor and version of the compiler,
the target architecture and bitwidth, the location of corresponding utilities
etc.

The ``ENABLED_LANGUAGES`` global property contains the languages which
are currently enabled.

Variables and Properties
========================

Several variables relate to the language components of a toolchain which are
enabled. ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`` is the full path to the compiler used
for ``<LANG>``. ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` is the identifier used
by CMake for the compiler and ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION`` is the
version of the compiler.

The ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` variables and the configuration-specific
equivalents contain flags that will be added to the compile command when
compiling a file of a particular language.

As the linker is invoked by the compiler driver, CMake needs a way to determine
which compiler to use to invoke the linker. This is calculated by the
``LANGUAGE`` of source files in the target, and in the case of static
libraries, the language of the dependent libraries. The choice CMake makes may
be overridden with the ``LINKER_LANGUAGE`` target property.

Toolchain Features
==================

CMake provides the ``try_compile()`` command and wrapper macros such as
``CheckCXXSourceCompiles``, ``CheckCXXSymbolExists`` and
``CheckIncludeFile`` to test capability and availability of various
toolchain features. These APIs test the toolchain in some way and cache the
result so that the test does not have to be performed again the next time
CMake runs.

Some toolchain features have built-in handling in CMake, and do not require
compile-tests. For example, ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` allows
specifying that a target should be built as position-independent code, if
the compiler supports that feature. The ``<LANG>_VISIBILITY_PRESET``
and ``VISIBILITY_INLINES_HIDDEN`` target properties add flags for
hidden visibility, if supported by the compiler.

Cross Compiling
===============

If ``cmake(1)`` is invoked with the command line parameter
``-DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=path/to/file``, the file will be loaded early to set
values for the compilers.
The ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` variable is set to true when CMake is
cross-compiling.

Note that using the ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` or ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``
variables inside a toolchain file is typically undesirable.  The toolchain
file is used in contexts where these variables have different values when used
in different places (e.g. as part of a call to ``try_compile()``).  In most
cases, where there is a need to evaluate paths inside a toolchain file, the more
appropriate variable to use would be ``CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR``, since
it always has an unambiguous, predictable value.

Cross Compiling for Linux
-------------------------

A typical cross-compiling toolchain for Linux has content such
as:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

 set(CMAKE_SYSROOT /home/devel/rasp-pi-rootfs)
 set(CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX /home/devel/stage)

 set(tools /home/devel/gcc-4.7-linaro-rpi-gnueabihf)
 set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER ${tools}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc)
 set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER ${tools}/bin/arm-linux-gnueabihf-g++)

 set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM NEVER)
 set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY ONLY)
 set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE ONLY)
 set(CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE ONLY)

The ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is the CMake-identifier of the target platform
to build for.

The ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`` is the CMake-identifier of the target architecture
to build for.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` is optional, and may be specified if a sysroot
is available.

The ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` is also optional. It may be used to specify
a path on the host to install to. The ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` is always
the runtime installation location, even when cross-compiling.

The ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER`` variables may be set to full paths, or to
names of compilers to search for in standard locations.   For toolchains that
do not support linking binaries without custom flags or scripts one may set
the ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE`` variable to ``STATIC_LIBRARY``
to tell CMake not to try to link executables during its checks.

CMake ``find_*`` commands will look in the sysroot, and the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
entries by default in all cases, as well as looking in the host system root prefix.
Although this can be controlled on a case-by-case basis, when cross-compiling, it
can be useful to exclude looking in either the host or the target for particular
artifacts. Generally, includes, libraries and packages should be found in the
target system prefixes, whereas executables which must be run as part of the build
should be found only on the host and not on the target. This is the purpose of
the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_*`` variables.

Cross Compiling for the Cray Linux Environment
----------------------------------------------

Cross compiling for compute nodes in the Cray Linux Environment can be done
without needing a separate toolchain file.  Specifying
``-DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=CrayLinuxEnvironment`` on the CMake command line will
ensure that the appropriate build settings and search paths are configured.
The platform will pull its configuration from the current environment
variables and will configure a project to use the compiler wrappers from the
Cray Programming Environment's ``PrgEnv-*`` modules if present and loaded.

The default configuration of the Cray Programming Environment is to only
support static libraries.  This can be overridden and shared libraries
enabled by setting the ``CRAYPE_LINK_TYPE`` environment variable to
``dynamic``.

Running CMake without specifying ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` will
run the configure step in host mode assuming a standard Linux environment.
If not overridden, the ``PrgEnv-*`` compiler wrappers will end up getting used,
which if targeting the either the login node or compute node, is likely not the
desired behavior.  The exception to this would be if you are building directly
on a NID instead of cross-compiling from a login node. If trying to build
software for a login node, you will need to either first unload the
currently loaded ``PrgEnv-*`` module or explicitly tell CMake to use the
system compilers in ``/usr/bin`` instead of the Cray wrappers.  If instead
targeting a compute node is desired, just specify the
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` as mentioned above.

Cross Compiling using Clang
---------------------------

Some compilers such as Clang are inherently cross compilers.
The ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET`` can be set to pass a
value to those supported compilers when compiling:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Linux)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

 set(triple arm-linux-gnueabihf)

 set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER clang)
 set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET ${triple})
 set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER clang++)
 set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_TARGET ${triple})

Similarly, some compilers do not ship their own supplementary utilities
such as linkers, but provide a way to specify the location of the external
toolchain which will be used by the compiler driver. The
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` variable can be set in a
toolchain file to pass the path to the compiler driver.

Cross Compiling for QNX
-----------------------

As the Clang compiler the QNX QCC compile is inherently a cross compiler.
And the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET`` can be set to pass a
value to those supported compilers when compiling:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME QNX)

 set(arch gcc_ntoarmv7le)

 set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER qcc)
 set(CMAKE_C_COMPILER_TARGET ${arch})
 set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER QCC)
 set(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER_TARGET ${arch})

Cross Compiling for Windows CE
------------------------------

Cross compiling for Windows CE requires the corresponding SDK being
installed on your system.  These SDKs are usually installed under
``C:/Program Files (x86)/Windows CE Tools/SDKs``.

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for
Windows CE may look like this:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsCE)

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.0)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR arm)

 set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET CE800) # Can be omitted for 8.0
 set(CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM SDK_AM335X_SK_WEC2013_V310)

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` tells the generator which SDK to use.
Further ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` tells the generator what version of
Windows CE to use.  Currently version 8.0 (Windows Embedded Compact 2013) is
supported out of the box.  Other versions may require one to set
``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` to the correct value.

Cross Compiling for Windows 10 Universal Applications
-----------------------------------------------------

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for a
Windows 10 Universal Application may look like this:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsStore)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 10.0)

A Windows 10 Universal Application targets both Windows Store and
Windows Phone.  Specify the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` variable
to be ``10.0`` to build with the latest available Windows 10 SDK.
Specify a more specific version (e.g. ``10.0.10240.0`` for RTM)
to build with the corresponding SDK.

Cross Compiling for Windows Phone
---------------------------------

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for
Windows Phone may look like this:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsPhone)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.1)

Cross Compiling for Windows Store
---------------------------------

A toolchain file to configure a Visual Studio generator for
Windows Store may look like this:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME WindowsStore)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 8.1)

Cross Compiling for Android
---------------------------

A toolchain file may configure cross-compiling for Android by setting the
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable to ``Android``.  Further configuration
is specific to the Android development environment to be used.

For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`, CMake expects :ref:`NVIDIA Nsight Tegra
Visual Studio Edition <Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra
Visual Studio Edition>` to be installed.  See that section for further
configuration details.

For :ref:`Makefile Generators` and the ``Ninja`` generator,
CMake expects one of these environments:

* :ref:`NDK <Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK>`
* :ref:`Standalone Toolchain <Cross Compiling for Android with a Standalone Toolchain>`

CMake uses the following steps to select one of the environments:

* If the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK`` variable is set, the NDK at the
  specified location will be used.

* Else, if the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`` variable
  is set, the Standalone Toolchain at the specified location will be used.

* Else, if the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable is set to a directory
  of the form ``<ndk>/platforms/android-<api>/arch-<arch>``, the ``<ndk>``
  part will be used as the value of ``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK`` and the
  NDK will be used.

* Else, if the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable is set to a directory of the
  form ``<standalone-toolchain>/sysroot``, the ``<standalone-toolchain>`` part
  will be used as the value of ``CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN``
  and the Standalone Toolchain will be used.

* Else, if a cmake variable ``ANDROID_NDK`` is set it will be used
  as the value of ``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK``, and the NDK will be used.

* Else, if a cmake variable ``ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`` is set, it will be
  used as the value of ``CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN``, and the
  Standalone Toolchain will be used.

* Else, if an environment variable ``ANDROID_NDK_ROOT`` or
  ``ANDROID_NDK`` is set, it will be used as the value of
  ``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK``, and the NDK will be used.

* Else, if an environment variable ``ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN`` is
  set then it will be used as the value of
  ``CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN``, and the Standalone
  Toolchain will be used.

* Else, an error diagnostic will be issued that neither the NDK or
  Standalone Toolchain can be found.

Cross Compiling for Android with the NDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A toolchain file may configure :ref:`Makefile Generators` or the
``Ninja`` generator to target Android for cross-compiling.

Configure use of an Android NDK with the following variables:

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``
  Set to ``Android``.  Must be specified to enable cross compiling
  for Android.

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION``
  Set to the Android API level.  If not specified, the value is
  determined as follows:

  * If the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_API`` variable is set, its value
    is used as the API level.
  * If the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` variable is set, the API level is
    detected from the NDK directory structure containing the sysroot.
  * Otherwise, the latest API level available in the NDK is used.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI``
  Set to the Android ABI (architecture).  If not specified, this
  variable will default to ``armeabi``.
  The ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH`` variable will be computed
  from ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI`` automatically.
  Also see the ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE`` and
  ``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON`` variables.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK``
  Set to the absolute path to the Android NDK root directory.
  A ``${CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK}/platforms`` directory must exist.
  If not specified, a default for this variable will be chosen
  as specified :ref:`above <Cross Compiling for Android>`.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_DEPRECATED_HEADERS``
  Set to a true value to use the deprecated per-api-level headers
  instead of the unified headers.  If not specified, the default will
  be false unless using a NDK that does not provide unified headers.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK_TOOLCHAIN_VERSION``
  On NDK r19 or above, this variable must be unset or set to ``clang``.
  On NDK r18 or below, set this to the version of the NDK toolchain to
  be selected as the compiler.  If not specified, the default will be
  the latest available GCC toolchain.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE``
  Set to specify which C++ standard library to use.  If not specified,
  a default will be selected as described in the variable documentation.

The following variables will be computed and provided automatically:

``CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX``
  The absolute path prefix to the binutils in the NDK toolchain.

``CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX``
  The host platform suffix of the binutils in the NDK toolchain.


For example, a toolchain file might contain:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Android)
 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION 21) # API level
 set(CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI arm64-v8a)
 set(CMAKE_ANDROID_NDK /path/to/android-ndk)
 set(CMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE gnustl_static)

Alternatively one may specify the values without a toolchain file:

 $ cmake ../src \
   -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Android \
   -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION=21 \
   -DCMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI=arm64-v8a \
   -DCMAKE_ANDROID_NDK=/path/to/android-ndk \
   -DCMAKE_ANDROID_STL_TYPE=gnustl_static

Cross Compiling for Android with a Standalone Toolchain
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A toolchain file may configure :ref:`Makefile Generators` or the
``Ninja`` generator to target Android for cross-compiling
using a standalone toolchain.

Configure use of an Android standalone toolchain with the following variables:

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``
  Set to ``Android``.  Must be specified to enable cross compiling
  for Android.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN``
  Set to the absolute path to the standalone toolchain root directory.
  A ``${CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN}/sysroot`` directory
  must exist.
  If not specified, a default for this variable will be chosen
  as specified :ref:`above <Cross Compiling for Android>`.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_MODE``
  When the standalone toolchain targets ARM, optionally set this to ``ON``
  to target 32-bit ARM instead of 16-bit Thumb.
  See variable documentation for details.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARM_NEON``
  When the standalone toolchain targets ARM v7, optionally set thisto ``ON``
  to target ARM NEON devices.  See variable documentation for details.

The following variables will be computed and provided automatically:

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION``
  The Android API level detected from the standalone toolchain.

``CMAKE_ANDROID_ARCH_ABI``
  The Android ABI detected from the standalone toolchain.

``CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_PREFIX``
  The absolute path prefix to the ``binutils`` in the standalone toolchain.

``CMAKE_<LANG>_ANDROID_TOOLCHAIN_SUFFIX``
  The host platform suffix of the ``binutils`` in the standalone toolchain.

For example, a toolchain file might contain:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Android)
 set(CMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN /path/to/android-toolchain)

Alternatively one may specify the values without a toolchain file:

 $ cmake ../src \
   -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Android \
   -DCMAKE_ANDROID_STANDALONE_TOOLCHAIN=/path/to/android-toolchain

Cross Compiling for Android with NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A toolchain file to configure one of the :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
to build using NVIDIA Nsight Tegra targeting Android may look like this:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Android)

The ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` may be set to select
the Nsight Tegra "Toolchain Version" value.

See also target properties:

* ``ANDROID_ANT_ADDITIONAL_OPTIONS``
* ``ANDROID_API_MIN``
* ``ANDROID_API``
* ``ANDROID_ARCH``
* ``ANDROID_ASSETS_DIRECTORIES``
* ``ANDROID_GUI``
* ``ANDROID_JAR_DEPENDENCIES``
* ``ANDROID_JAR_DIRECTORIES``
* ``ANDROID_JAVA_SOURCE_DIR``
* ``ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DEPENDENCIES``
* ``ANDROID_NATIVE_LIB_DIRECTORIES``
* ``ANDROID_PROCESS_MAX``
* ``ANDROID_PROGUARD_CONFIG_PATH``
* ``ANDROID_PROGUARD``
* ``ANDROID_SECURE_PROPS_PATH``
* ``ANDROID_SKIP_ANT_STEP``
* ``ANDROID_STL_TYPE``

Cross Compiling for iOS, tvOS, or watchOS
-----------------------------------------

For cross-compiling to iOS, tvOS, or watchOS, the ``Xcode``
generator is recommended.  The ``Unix Makefiles`` or
``Ninja`` generators can also be used, but they require the
project to handle more areas like target CPU selection and code signing.

Any of the three systems can be targeted by setting the
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable to a value from the table below.
By default, the latest Device SDK is chosen.  As for all Apple platforms,
a different SDK (e.g. a simulator) can be selected by setting the
``CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`` variable, although this should rarely be
necessary (see :ref:`Switching Between Device and Simulator` below).
A list of available SDKs can be obtained by running ``xcodebuild -showsdks``.

=======  ================= ==================== ================
OS       CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME Device SDK (default) Simulator SDK
=======  ================= ==================== ================
iOS      iOS               iphoneos             iphonesimulator
tvOS     tvOS              appletvos            appletvsimulator
watchOS  watchOS           watchos              watchsimulator
=======  ================= ==================== ================

For example, to create a CMake configuration for iOS, the following
command is sufficient:

 cmake .. -GXcode -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS

Variable ``CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES`` can be used to set architectures
for both device and simulator. Variable ``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET``
can be used to set an iOS/tvOS/watchOS deployment target.

Next configuration will install fat 5 architectures iOS library
and add the ``-miphoneos-version-min=9.3``/``-mios-simulator-version-min=9.3``
flags to the compiler:

 $ cmake -S. -B_builds -GXcode \
     -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
     "-DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=armv7;armv7s;arm64;i386;x86_64" \
     -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=9.3 \
     -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=`pwd`/_install \
     -DCMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH=NO \
     -DCMAKE_IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED=YES

Example:

 # CMakeLists.txt
 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.14)
 project(foo)
 add_library(foo foo.cpp)
 install(TARGETS foo DESTINATION lib)

Install:

 $ cmake --build _builds --config Release --target install

Check library:

 $ lipo -info _install/lib/libfoo.a
 Architectures in the fat file: _install/lib/libfoo.a are: i386 armv7 armv7s x86_64 arm64

 $ otool -l _install/lib/libfoo.a | grep -A2 LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS
       cmd LC_VERSION_MIN_IPHONEOS
   cmdsize 16
   version 9.3

Code Signing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some build artifacts for the embedded Apple platforms require mandatory
code signing.  If the ``Xcode`` generator is being used and
code signing is required or desired, the development team ID can be
specified via the ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`` CMake variable.
This team ID will then be included in the generated Xcode project.
By default, CMake avoids the need for code signing during the internal
configuration phase (i.e compiler ID and feature detection).

Switching Between Device and Simulator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When configuring for any of the embedded platforms, one can target either
real devices or the simulator.  Both have their own separate SDK, but CMake
only supports specifying a single SDK for the configuration phase.  This
means the developer must select one or the other at configuration time.
When using the ``Xcode`` generator, this is less of a limitation
because Xcode still allows you to build for either a device or a simulator,
even though configuration was only performed for one of the two.  From
within the Xcode IDE, builds are performed for the selected "destination"
platform.  When building from the command line, the desired sdk can be
specified directly by passing a ``-sdk`` option to the underlying build
tool (``xcodebuild``).  For example:

 $ cmake --build ... -- -sdk iphonesimulator

Please note that checks made during configuration were performed against
the configure-time SDK and might not hold true for other SDKs.  Commands
like ``find_package()``, ``find_library()``, etc. store and use
details only for the configured SDK/platform, so they can be problematic
if wanting to switch between device and simulator builds. You can follow
the next rules to make device + simulator configuration work:

- Use explicit ``-l`` linker flag,
  e.g. ``target_link_libraries(foo PUBLIC "-lz")``

- Use explicit ``-framework`` linker flag,
  e.g. ``target_link_libraries(foo PUBLIC "-framework CoreFoundation")``

- Use ``find_package()`` only for libraries installed with
  ``CMAKE_IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED`` feature

cmake-variables(7)
******************

This page documents variables that are provided by CMake
or have meaning to CMake when set by project code.

For general information on variables, see the
:ref:`Variables <CMake Language Variables>`
section in the cmake-language manual.


Variables that Provide Information
==================================

CMAKE_AR
--------

Name of archiving tool for static libraries.

This specifies the name of the program that creates archive or static
libraries.

CMAKE_ARGC
----------

Number of command line arguments passed to CMake in script mode.

When run in :ref:`-P <Script Processing Mode>` script mode, CMake sets this
variable to the number of command line arguments.  See also
``CMAKE_ARGV0``, ``1``, ``2`` ...

CMAKE_ARGV0
-----------

Command line argument passed to CMake in script mode.

When run in :ref:`-P <Script Processing Mode>` script mode, CMake sets this
variable to the first command line argument.  It then also sets ``CMAKE_ARGV1``,
``CMAKE_ARGV2``, ... and so on, up to the number of command line arguments
given.  See also ``CMAKE_ARGC``.

CMAKE_BINARY_DIR
----------------

The path to the top level of the build tree.

This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake build
tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``, ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``,
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` and
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` to the current working directory.

CMAKE_BUILD_TOOL
----------------

This variable exists only for backwards compatibility.
It contains the same value as ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM``.
Use that variable instead.

CMAKE_CACHEFILE_DIR
-------------------

The directory with the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file.

This is the full path to the directory that has the ``CMakeCache.txt``
file in it.  This is the same as ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``.

CMAKE_CACHE_MAJOR_VERSION
-------------------------

Major version of CMake used to create the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file

This stores the major version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.

CMAKE_CACHE_MINOR_VERSION
-------------------------

Minor version of CMake used to create the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file

This stores the minor version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.

CMAKE_CACHE_PATCH_VERSION
-------------------------

Patch version of CMake used to create the ``CMakeCache.txt`` file

This stores the patch version of CMake used to write a CMake cache
file.  It is only different when a different version of CMake is run
on a previously created cache file.

CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR
----------------

Build-time reference to per-configuration output subdirectory.

For native build systems supporting multiple configurations in the
build tree (such as :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` and ``Xcode``),
the value is a reference to a build-time variable specifying the name
of the per-configuration output subdirectory.  On :ref:`Makefile Generators`
this evaluates to `.` because there is only one configuration in a build tree.
Example values:

::

 $(ConfigurationName) = Visual Studio 9
 $(Configuration)     = Visual Studio 10
 $(CONFIGURATION)     = Xcode
 .                    = Make-based tools

Since these values are evaluated by the native build system, this
variable is suitable only for use in command lines that will be
evaluated at build time.  Example of intended usage:

::

 add_executable(mytool mytool.c)
 add_custom_command(
   OUTPUT out.txt
   COMMAND ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool
           ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/in.txt out.txt
   DEPENDS mytool in.txt
   )
 add_custom_target(drive ALL DEPENDS out.txt)

Note that ``CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR`` is no longer necessary for this purpose but
has been left for compatibility with existing projects.  Instead
``add_custom_command()`` recognizes executable target names in its
``COMMAND`` option, so
``${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/${CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR}/mytool`` can be replaced
by just ``mytool``.

This variable is read-only.  Setting it is undefined behavior.  In
multi-configuration build systems the value of this variable is passed
as the value of preprocessor symbol ``CMAKE_INTDIR`` to the compilation
of all source files.

CMAKE_COMMAND
-------------

The full path to the ``cmake(1)`` executable.

This is the full path to the CMake executable ``cmake(1)`` which is
useful from custom commands that want to use the ``cmake -E`` option for
portable system commands.  (e.g.  ``/usr/local/bin/cmake``)

CMAKE_CPACK_COMMAND
-------------------

Full path to ``cpack(1)`` command installed with CMake.

This is the full path to the CPack executable ``cpack(1)`` which is
useful from custom commands that want to use the ``cmake(1)`` ``-E``
option for portable system commands.

CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING
--------------------

Intended to indicate whether CMake is cross compiling, but note limitations
discussed below.

This variable will be set to true by CMake if the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``
variable has been set manually (i.e. in a toolchain file or as a cache entry
from the ``cmake`` command line). In most cases, manually
setting ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` will only be done when cross compiling,
since it will otherwise be given the same value as
``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`` if not manually set, which is correct for
the non-cross-compiling case. In the event that ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``
is manually set to the same value as ``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME``, then
``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` will still be set to true.

Another case to be aware of is that builds targeting Apple platforms other than
macOS are handled differently to other cross compiling scenarios. Rather than
relying on ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` to select the target platform, Apple
device builds use ``CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`` to select the appropriate SDK,
which indirectly determines the target platform. Furthermore, when using the
``Xcode`` generator, developers can switch between device and
simulator builds at build time rather than having a single
choice at configure time, so the concept
of whether the build is cross compiling or not is more complex. Therefore, the
use of ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` is not recommended for projects targeting Apple
devices.

CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR
-----------------------------

This variable is only used when ``CMAKE_CROSSCOMPILING`` is on. It
should point to a command on the host system that can run executable built
for the target system.

If this variable contains a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language
Lists>`, then the first value is the command and remaining values are its
arguments.

The command will be used to run ``try_run()`` generated executables,
which avoids manual population of the ``TryRunResults.cmake`` file.

It is also used as the default value for the
``CROSSCOMPILING_EMULATOR`` target property of executables.

CMAKE_CTEST_COMMAND
-------------------

Full path to ``ctest(1)`` command installed with CMake.

This is the full path to the CTest executable ``ctest(1)`` which is
useful from custom commands that want to use the ``cmake(1)`` ``-E``
option for portable system commands.

CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR
------------------------

The path to the binary directory currently being processed.

This the full path to the build directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.  Each directory added by ``add_subdirectory()`` will
create a binary directory in the build tree, and as it is being
processed this variable will be set.  For in-source builds this is the
current source directory being processed.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``, ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``,
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` and
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` to the current working directory.

CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR
----------------------

Full directory of the listfile currently being processed.

As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the directory where the listfile which is currently
being processed (``CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE``) is located.  The value
has dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the directory where this file is located.
When CMake finishes processing commands from the file it restores the
previous value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or
function is the directory of the file invoking the bottom-most entry
on the call stack, not the directory of the file containing the macro
or function definition.

See also ``CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE``.

CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE
-----------------------

Full path to the listfile currently being processed.

As CMake processes the listfiles in your project this variable will
always be set to the one currently being processed.  The value has
dynamic scope.  When CMake starts processing commands in a source file
it sets this variable to the location of the file.  When CMake
finishes processing commands from the file it restores the previous
value.  Therefore the value of the variable inside a macro or function
is the file invoking the bottom-most entry on the call stack, not the
file containing the macro or function definition.

See also ``CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE``.

CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_LINE
-----------------------

The line number of the current file being processed.

This is the line number of the file currently being processed by
cmake.

CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR
------------------------

The path to the source directory currently being processed.

This the full path to the source directory that is currently being
processed by cmake.

When run in -P script mode, CMake sets the variables
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``, ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``,
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` and
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` to the current working directory.

CMAKE_DIRECTORY_LABELS
-----------------------

Specify labels for the current directory.

This is used to initialize the ``LABELS`` directory property.

CMAKE_DL_LIBS
-------------

Name of library containing ``dlopen`` and ``dlclose``.

The name of the library that has ``dlopen`` and ``dlclose`` in it, usually
``-ldl`` on most UNIX machines.

CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION
-------------------------------------

Default value for ``DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION``
property of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the
``DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`` property on all
targets. See that target property for additional information.

Setting ``CMAKE_DOTNET_TARGET_FRAMEWORK_VERSION`` may be necessary
when working with ``C#`` and newer .NET framework versions to
avoid referencing errors with the ``ALL_BUILD`` CMake target.

This variable is only evaluated for :ref:`Visual Studio Generators`
VS 2010 and above.

CMAKE_EDIT_COMMAND
------------------

Full path to ``cmake-gui(1)`` or ``ccmake(1)``.  Defined only for
:ref:`Makefile Generators` when not using an "extra" generator for an IDE.

This is the full path to the CMake executable that can graphically
edit the cache.  For example, ``cmake-gui(1)`` or ``ccmake(1)``.

CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX
-----------------------

The suffix for executables on this platform.

The suffix to use for the end of an executable filename if any, ``.exe``
on Windows.

``CMAKE_EXECUTABLE_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR
---------------------

The extra generator used to build the project.  See
``cmake-generators(7)``.

When using the Eclipse, CodeBlocks, CodeLite, Kate or Sublime generators, CMake
generates Makefiles (``CMAKE_GENERATOR``) and additionally project
files for the respective IDE.  This IDE project file generator is stored in
``CMAKE_EXTRA_GENERATOR`` (e.g.  ``Eclipse CDT4``).

CMAKE_EXTRA_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
-----------------------------------

Additional suffixes for shared libraries.

Extensions for shared libraries other than that specified by
``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX``, if any.  CMake uses this to recognize
external shared library files during analysis of libraries linked by a
target.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NAME
-----------------------

Defined by the ``find_package()`` command while loading
a find module to record the caller-specified package name.
See command documentation for details.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION
---------------------------------

The sorting direction used by ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER``.
It can assume one of the following values:

``DEC``
  Default.  Ordering is done in descending mode.
  The highest folder found will be tested first.

``ASC``
  Ordering is done in ascending mode.
  The lowest folder found will be tested first.

If ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER`` is not set or is set to ``NONE``
this variable has no effect.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER
-----------------------------

The default order for sorting packages found using ``find_package()``.
It can assume one of the following values:

``NONE``
  Default.  No attempt is done to sort packages.
  The first valid package found will be selected.

``NAME``
  Sort packages lexicographically before selecting one.

``NATURAL``
  Sort packages using natural order (see ``strverscmp(3)`` manual),
  i.e. such that contiguous digits are compared as whole numbers.

Natural sorting can be employed to return the highest version when multiple
versions of the same library are found by ``find_package()``.  For
example suppose that the following libraries have been found:

* libX-1.1.0
* libX-1.2.9
* libX-1.2.10

By setting ``NATURAL`` order we can select the one with the highest
version number ``libX-1.2.10``.

 set(CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_ORDER NATURAL)
 find_package(libX CONFIG)

The sort direction can be controlled using the
``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_SORT_DIRECTION`` variable
(by default decrescent, e.g. lib-B will be tested before lib-A).

CMAKE_GENERATOR
---------------

The generator used to build the project.  See ``cmake-generators(7)``.

The name of the generator that is being used to generate the build
files.  (e.g.  ``Unix Makefiles``, ``Ninja``, etc.)

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A generator may be selected via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-G`` option,
interactively in ``cmake-gui(1)``, or via the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR``
environment variable.

CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE
------------------------

Generator-specific instance specification provided by user.

Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build
system when multiple instances are available.  If the user specifies an
instance (e.g. by setting this cache entry or via the
``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` environment variable), or after a default
instance is chosen when a build tree is first configured, the value will be
available in this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``
variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` as a cache entry.
Once a given build tree has been initialized with a particular value
for this variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

Instance specification is supported only on specific generators:

* For the ``Visual Studio 15 2017`` generator (and above)
  this specifies the absolute path to the VS installation directory
  of the selected VS instance.

See native build system documentation for allowed instance values.

CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM
------------------------

Generator-specific target platform specification provided by user.

Some CMake generators support a target platform name to be given
to the native build system to choose a compiler toolchain.
If the user specifies a platform name (e.g. via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-A``
option or via the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` environment variable)
the value will be available in this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``
variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``.  Once a given
build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this
variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

Platform specification is supported only on specific generators:

* For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` with VS 2005 and above this
  specifies the target architecture.

* For ``Green Hills MULTI`` this specifies the target architecture.

See native build system documentation for allowed platform names.

Visual Studio Platform Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

On :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` the selected platform name
is provided in the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable.

CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET
-----------------------

Native build system toolset specification provided by user.

Some CMake generators support a toolset specification to tell the
native build system how to choose a compiler.  If the user specifies
a toolset (e.g. via the ``cmake(1)`` ``-T`` option or via
the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` environment variable) the value
will be available in this variable.

The value of this variable should never be modified by project code.
A toolchain file specified by the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``
variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET``.  Once a given
build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this
variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

Toolset specification is supported only on specific generators:

* :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above
* The ``Xcode`` generator for Xcode 3.0 and above
* The ``Green Hills MULTI`` generator

See native build system documentation for allowed toolset names.

Visual Studio Toolset Selection
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` support toolset specification
using one of these forms:

* ``toolset``
* ``toolset[,key=value]*``
* ``key=value[,key=value]*``

The ``toolset`` specifies the toolset name.  The selected toolset name
is provided in the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET`` variable.

The ``key=value`` pairs form a comma-separated list of options to
specify generator-specific details of the toolset selection.
Supported pairs are:

``cuda=<version>|<path>``
  Specify the CUDA toolkit version to use or the path to a
  standalone CUDA toolkit directory.  Supported by VS 2010
  and above. The version can only be used with the CUDA
  toolkit VS integration globally installed.
  See the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA`` and
  ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA_CUSTOM_DIR`` variables.

``host=<arch>``
  Specify the host tools architecture as ``x64`` or ``x86``.
  Supported by VS 2013 and above.
  See the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCHITECTURE``
  variable.

``version=<version>``
  Specify the toolset version to use.  Supported by VS 2017
  and above with the specified toolset installed.
  See the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION`` variable.

CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX
---------------------------

The prefix for import libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of an import library if used on this
platform.

``CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
---------------------------

The suffix for import libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of an import library filename if used on
this platform.

``CMAKE_IMPORT_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_JOB_POOL_COMPILE
----------------------

This variable is used to initialize the ``JOB_POOL_COMPILE``
property on all the targets. See ``JOB_POOL_COMPILE``
for additional information.

CMAKE_JOB_POOL_LINK
-------------------

This variable is used to initialize the ``JOB_POOL_LINK``
property on all the targets. See ``JOB_POOL_LINK``
for additional information.

CMAKE_JOB_POOLS
---------------

If the ``JOB_POOLS`` global property is not set, the value
of this variable is used in its place.  See ``JOB_POOLS``
for additional information.

CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_AR
------------------------

A wrapper around ``ar`` adding the appropriate ``--plugin`` option for the
compiler.

See also ``CMAKE_AR``.

CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_RANLIB
----------------------------

A wrapper around ``ranlib`` adding the appropriate ``--plugin`` option for the
compiler.

See also ``CMAKE_RANLIB``.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
--------------------------------

Language-specific suffix for libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a library filename, ``.lib`` on Windows.

CMAKE_LINK_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
-------------------------

The suffix for libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a library filename, ``.lib`` on Windows.

CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC
----------------------------

End a link line such that static system libraries are used.

Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the
end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type
back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker
search type to ``-Bstatic`` regardless of how it started.

This variable is used to initialize the target property
``LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC`` for all targets. If set, it's
value is also used by the ``try_compile()`` command.

See also ``CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC``.

CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC
------------------------------

Assume the linker looks for static libraries by default.

Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to
determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options.
CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full
paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link
directories for the platform.  By default the linker search type is
assumed to be ``-Bdynamic`` at the beginning of the library list.  This
property switches the assumption to ``-Bstatic``.  It is intended for use
when linking an executable statically (e.g.  with the GNU ``-static``
option).

This variable is used to initialize the target property
``LINK_SEARCH_START_STATIC`` for all targets.  If set, it's
value is also used by the ``try_compile()`` command.

See also ``CMAKE_LINK_SEARCH_END_STATIC``.

CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION
-------------------

First version number component of the ``CMAKE_VERSION``
variable.

CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM
------------------

Tool that can launch the native build system.
The value may be the full path to an executable or just the tool
name if it is expected to be in the ``PATH``.

The tool selected depends on the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR`` used
to configure the project:

* The :ref:`Makefile Generators` set this to ``make``, ``gmake``, or
  a generator-specific tool (e.g. ``nmake`` for ``NMake Makefiles``).

  These generators store ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  so that it may be edited by the user.

* The ``Ninja`` generator sets this to ``ninja``.

  This generator stores ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  so that it may be edited by the user.

* The ``Xcode`` generator sets this to ``xcodebuild``.

  This generator prefers to lookup the build tool at build time
  rather than to store ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  ahead of time.  This is because ``xcodebuild`` is easy to find.

  For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.2, if
  a user or project explicitly adds ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value.

* The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` set this to the full path to
  ``MSBuild.exe`` (VS >= 10), ``devenv.com`` (VS 7,8,9), or
  ``VCExpress.exe`` (VS Express 8,9).
  (See also variables
  ``CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND`` and
  ``CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND``.

  These generators prefer to lookup the build tool at build time
  rather than to store ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` in the CMake cache
  ahead of time.  This is because the tools are version-specific
  and can be located using the Windows Registry.  It is also
  necessary because the proper build tool may depend on the
  project content (e.g. the Intel Fortran plugin to VS 10 and 11
  requires ``devenv.com`` to build its ``.vfproj`` project files
  even though ``MSBuild.exe`` is normally preferred to support
  the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET``).

  For compatibility with versions of CMake prior to 3.0, if
  a user or project explicitly adds ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` to
  the CMake cache then CMake will use the specified value if
  possible.

* The ``Green Hills MULTI`` generator sets this to the full
  path to ``gbuild.exe(Windows)`` or ``gbuild(Linux)`` based upon
  the toolset being used.

  Once the generator has initialized a particular value for this
  variable, changing the value has undefined behavior.

The ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` variable is set for use by project code.
The value is also used by the ``cmake(1)`` ``--build`` and
``ctest(1)`` ``--build-and-test`` tools to launch the native
build process.

CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT
-----------------

The number of matches with the last regular expression.

When a regular expression match is used, CMake fills in
``CMAKE_MATCH_<n>`` variables with the match contents.
The ``CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT`` variable holds the number of match
expressions when these are filled.

CMAKE_MATCH_<n>
---------------

Capture group ``<n>`` matched by the last regular expression, for groups
0 through 9.  Group 0 is the entire match.  Groups 1 through 9 are the
subexpressions captured by ``()`` syntax.

When a regular expression match is used, CMake fills in ``CMAKE_MATCH_<n>``
variables with the match contents.  The ``CMAKE_MATCH_COUNT``
variable holds the number of match expressions when these are filled.

CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT
--------------------

The ``message()`` command joins the strings from this list and for
log levels of ``NOTICE`` and below, it prepends the resultant string to
each line of the message.

Example:

 list(APPEND listVar one two three)

 message(VERBOSE [[Collected items in the "listVar":]])
 list(APPEND CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT "  ")

 foreach(item IN LISTS listVar)
   message(VERBOSE ${item})
 endforeach()

 list(POP_BACK CMAKE_MESSAGE_INDENT)
 message(VERBOSE "No more indent")

Which results in the following output:

 -- Collected items in the "listVar":
 --   one
 --   two
 --   three
 -- No more indent

CMAKE_MINIMUM_REQUIRED_VERSION
------------------------------

The ``<min>`` version of CMake given to the most recent call to the
``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)`` command.

CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION
-------------------

Second version number component of the ``CMAKE_VERSION``
variable.

CMAKE_NETRC
-----------

This variable is used to initialize the ``NETRC`` option for
``file(DOWNLOAD)`` and ``file(UPLOAD)`` commands and the
module ``ExternalProject``. See those commands for additional
information.

The local option takes precedence over this variable.

CMAKE_NETRC_FILE
----------------

This variable is used to initialize the ``NETRC_FILE`` option for
``file(DOWNLOAD)`` and ``file(UPLOAD)`` commands and the
module ``ExternalProject``. See those commands for additional
information.

The local option takes precedence over this variable.

CMAKE_PARENT_LIST_FILE
----------------------

Full path to the CMake file that included the current one.

While processing a CMake file loaded by ``include()`` or
``find_package()`` this variable contains the full path to the file
including it.  The top of the include stack is always the ``CMakeLists.txt``
for the current directory.  See also ``CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_FILE``.

CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION
-------------------

Third version number component of the ``CMAKE_VERSION``
variable.

CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
-------------------------

The description of the top level project.

This variable holds the description of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple ``project()`` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
 project(First DESCRIPTION "I am First")
 project(Second DESCRIPTION "I am Second")
 add_subdirectory(sub)
 project(Third DESCRIPTION "I am Third")

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

 project(SubProj DESCRIPTION "I am SubProj")
 message("CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION}")

The most recently seen ``project()`` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

 CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION = I am Second

To obtain the description from the most recent call to ``project()`` in
the current directory scope or above, see the ``PROJECT_DESCRIPTION``
variable.

CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL
--------------------------

The homepage URL of the top level project.

This variable holds the homepage URL of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple ``project()`` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
 project(First HOMEPAGE_URL "http://first.example.com")
 project(Second HOMEPAGE_URL "http://second.example.com")
 add_subdirectory(sub)
 project(Third HOMEPAGE_URL "http://third.example.com")

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

 project(SubProj HOMEPAGE_URL "http://subproj.example.com")
 message("CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL}")

The most recently seen ``project()`` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

 CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL = http://second.example.com

To obtain the homepage URL from the most recent call to ``project()`` in
the current directory scope or above, see the ``PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL``
variable.

CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME
------------------

The name of the top level project.

This variable holds the name of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple ``project()`` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the name that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
 project(First)
 project(Second)
 add_subdirectory(sub)
 project(Third)

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

 project(SubProj)
 message("CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME}")

The most recently seen ``project()`` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second)``, so this will print::

 CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME = Second

To obtain the name from the most recent call to ``project()`` in
the current directory scope or above, see the ``PROJECT_NAME``
variable.

CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION
---------------------

The version of the top level project.

This variable holds the version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command.  In the event that
the top level CMakeLists.txt contains multiple ``project()`` calls,
the most recently called one from that top level CMakeLists.txt will determine
the value that ``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`` contains.  For example, consider
the following top level CMakeLists.txt:

 cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.0)
 project(First VERSION 1.2.3)
 project(Second VERSION 3.4.5)
 add_subdirectory(sub)
 project(Third VERSION 6.7.8)

And ``sub/CMakeLists.txt`` with the following contents:

 project(SubProj VERSION 1)
 message("CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = ${CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION}")

The most recently seen ``project()`` command from the top level
CMakeLists.txt would be ``project(Second ...)``, so this will print::

 CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION = 3.4.5

To obtain the version from the most recent call to ``project()`` in
the current directory scope or above, see the ``PROJECT_VERSION``
variable.

CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
---------------------------

The major version of the top level project.

This variable holds the major version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command. Please see
``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`` documentation for the behavior when
multiple ``project()`` commands are used in the sources.

CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
---------------------------

The minor version of the top level project.

This variable holds the minor version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command. Please see
``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`` documentation for the behavior when
multiple ``project()`` commands are used in the sources.

CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
---------------------------

The patch version of the top level project.

This variable holds the patch version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command. Please see
``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`` documentation for the behavior when
multiple ``project()`` commands are used in the sources.

CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK
---------------------------

The tweak version of the top level project.

This variable holds the tweak version of the project as specified in the top
level CMakeLists.txt file by a ``project()`` command. Please see
``CMAKE_PROJECT_VERSION`` documentation for the behavior when
multiple ``project()`` commands are used in the sources.

CMAKE_RANLIB
------------

Name of randomizing tool for static libraries.

This specifies name of the program that randomizes libraries on UNIX,
not used on Windows, but may be present.

CMAKE_ROOT
----------

Install directory for running cmake.

This is the install root for the running CMake and the ``Modules``
directory can be found here.  This is commonly used in this format:
``${CMAKE_ROOT}/Modules``

CMAKE_RULE_MESSAGES
-------------------

Specify whether to report a message for each make rule.

If set in the cache it is used to initialize the value of the ``RULE_MESSAGES`` property.
Users may disable the option in their local build tree to disable granular messages
and report only as each target completes in Makefile builds.

CMAKE_SCRIPT_MODE_FILE
----------------------

Full path to the ``cmake(1)`` ``-P`` script file currently being
processed.

When run in ``cmake(1)`` ``-P`` script mode, CMake sets this variable to
the full path of the script file.  When run to configure a ``CMakeLists.txt``
file, this variable is not set.

CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX
---------------------------

The prefix for shared libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a shared library, ``lib`` on UNIX.

``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
---------------------------

The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a shared library filename, ``.dll`` on
Windows.

``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX
--------------------------

The prefix for loadable modules that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a loadable module on this platform.

``CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX
--------------------------

The suffix for shared libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a loadable module filename on this
platform

``CMAKE_SHARED_MODULE_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P
-------------------

Size of a ``void`` pointer.

This is set to the size of a pointer on the target machine, and is determined
by a try compile.  If a 64-bit size is found, then the library search
path is modified to look for 64-bit libraries first.

CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RULES
------------------------

Whether to disable generation of installation rules.

If ``TRUE``, CMake will neither generate installation rules nor
will it generate ``cmake_install.cmake`` files. This variable is ``FALSE`` by
default.

CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH
----------------

If true, do not add run time path information.

If this is set to ``TRUE``, then the rpath information is not added to
compiled executables.  The default is to add rpath information if the
platform supports it.  This allows for easy running from the build
tree.  To omit RPATH in the install step, but not the build step, use
``CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH`` instead.

CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
----------------

The path to the top level of the source tree.

This is the full path to the top level of the current CMake source
tree.  For an in-source build, this would be the same as
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``.

When run in ``-P`` script mode, CMake sets the variables
``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR``, ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``,
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` and
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` to the current working directory.

CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX
---------------------------

The prefix for static libraries that you link to.

The prefix to use for the name of a static library, ``lib`` on UNIX.

``CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_PREFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX
---------------------------

The suffix for static libraries that you link to.

The suffix to use for the end of a static library filename, ``.lib`` on
Windows.

``CMAKE_STATIC_LIBRARY_SUFFIX_<LANG>`` overrides this for language ``<LANG>``.

CMAKE_Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY
----------------------------

Swift module output directory.

This variable is used to initialise the ``Swift_MODULE_DIRECTORY``
property on all the targets.  See the target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_Swift_NUM_THREADS
-----------------------

Number of threads for parallel compilation for Swift targets.

This variable controls the number of parallel jobs that the swift driver creates
for building targets.  If not specified, it will default to the number of
logical CPUs on the host.

CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE
--------------------

Path to toolchain file supplied to ``cmake(1)``.

This variable is specified on the command line when cross-compiling with CMake.
It is the path to a file which is read early in the CMake run and which
specifies locations for compilers and toolchain utilities, and other target
platform and compiler related information.

CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION
-------------------

Defined to ``0`` for compatibility with code written for older
CMake versions that may have defined higher values.

.. note::

  In CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12, this variable holds
  the fourth version number component of the
  ``CMAKE_VERSION`` variable.

CMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE
----------------------

Enable verbose output from Makefile builds.

This variable is a cache entry initialized (to ``FALSE``) by
the ``project()`` command.  Users may enable the option
in their local build tree to get more verbose output from
Makefile builds and show each command line as it is launched.

CMAKE_VERSION
-------------

The CMake version string as three non-negative integer components
separated by ``.`` and possibly followed by ``-`` and other information.
The first two components represent the feature level and the third
component represents either a bug-fix level or development date.

Release versions and release candidate versions of CMake use the format::

 <major>.<minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]

where the ``<patch>`` component is less than ``20000000``.  Development
versions of CMake use the format::

 <major>.<minor>.<date>[-<id>]

where the ``<date>`` component is of format ``CCYYMMDD`` and ``<id>``
may contain arbitrary text.  This represents development as of a
particular date following the ``<major>.<minor>`` feature release.

Individual component values are also available in variables:

* ``CMAKE_MAJOR_VERSION``
* ``CMAKE_MINOR_VERSION``
* ``CMAKE_PATCH_VERSION``
* ``CMAKE_TWEAK_VERSION``

Use the ``if()`` command ``VERSION_LESS``, ``VERSION_GREATER``,
``VERSION_EQUAL``, ``VERSION_LESS_EQUAL``, or ``VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL``
operators to compare version string values against ``CMAKE_VERSION`` using a
component-wise test.  Version component values may be 10 or larger so do not
attempt to compare version strings as floating-point numbers.

.. note::

  CMake versions 2.8.2 through 2.8.12 used three components for the
  feature level.  Release versions represented the bug-fix level in a
  fourth component, i.e. ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>[.<tweak>][-rc<n>]``.
  Development versions represented the development date in the fourth
  component, i.e. ``<major>.<minor>.<patch>.<date>[-<id>]``.

  CMake versions prior to 2.8.2 used three components for the
  feature level and had no bug-fix component.  Release versions
  used an even-valued second component, i.e.
  ``<major>.<even-minor>.<patch>[-rc<n>]``.  Development versions
  used an odd-valued second component with the development date as
  the third component, i.e. ``<major>.<odd-minor>.<date>``.

  The ``CMAKE_VERSION`` variable is defined by CMake 2.6.3 and higher.
  Earlier versions defined only the individual component variables.

CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND
-----------------------

The generators for ``Visual Studio 9 2008`` and above set this
variable to the ``devenv.com`` command installed with the corresponding
Visual Studio version.  Note that this variable may be empty on
Visual Studio Express editions because they do not provide this tool.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``devenv.com``
is installed on the computer.

The ``CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND`` is also provided for
``Visual Studio 10 2010`` and above.
See also the ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` variable.

CMAKE_VS_MSBUILD_COMMAND
------------------------

The generators for ``Visual Studio 10 2010`` and above set this
variable to the ``MSBuild.exe`` command installed with the corresponding
Visual Studio version.

This variable is not defined by other generators even if ``MSBuild.exe``
is installed on the computer.

The ``CMAKE_VS_DEVENV_COMMAND`` is also provided for the
non-Express editions of Visual Studio.
See also the ``CMAKE_MAKE_PROGRAM`` variable.

CMAKE_VS_NsightTegra_VERSION
----------------------------

When using a Visual Studio generator with the
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable set to ``Android``,
this variable contains the version number of the
installed NVIDIA Nsight Tegra Visual Studio Edition.

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME
----------------------

Visual Studio target platform name used by the current generator.

VS 8 and above allow project files to specify a target platform.
CMake provides the name of the chosen platform in this variable.
See the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM`` variable for details.

See also the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT`` variable.

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME_DEFAULT
------------------------------

Default for the Visual Studio target platform name for the current generator
without considering the value of the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM``
variable.  For :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 and below this is
always ``Win32``.  For VS 2019 and above this is based on the host platform.

See also the ``CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_NAME`` variable.

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
-------------------------

Visual Studio Platform Toolset name.

VS 10 and above use MSBuild under the hood and support multiple
compiler toolchains.  CMake may specify a toolset explicitly, such as
``v110`` for VS 11 or ``Windows7.1SDK`` for 64-bit support in VS 10
Express.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable.

See the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` variable for details.

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA
------------------------------

NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit version whose Visual Studio toolset to use.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using
a CUDA toolset provided by a CUDA Toolkit.  The toolset version number
may be specified by a field in ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` of
the form ``cuda=8.0``. Or it is automatically detected if a path to
a standalone CUDA directory is specified in the form ``cuda=C:\path\to\cuda``.
If none is specified CMake will choose a default version.
CMake provides the selected CUDA toolset version in this variable.
The value may be empty if no CUDA Toolkit with Visual Studio integration
is installed.

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_CUDA_CUSTOM_DIR
-----------------------------------------

Path to standalone NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit (eg. extracted from installer).

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2010 and above support using
a standalone (non-installed) NVIDIA CUDA toolkit.  The path
may be specified by a field in ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` of
the form ``cuda=C:\path\to\cuda``.  The given directory must at least
contain a folder ``.\nvcc`` and must provide Visual Studio integration
files in path ``.\CUDAVisualStudioIntegration\extras\
visual_studio_integration\MSBuildExtensions\``. One can create a standalone
CUDA toolkit directory by either opening a installer with 7zip or
copying the files that are extracted by the running installer.
The value may be empty if no path to a standalone CUDA Toolkit was
specified.

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_HOST_ARCHITECTURE
-------------------------------------------

Visual Studio preferred tool architecture.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2013 and above support using
either the 32-bit or 64-bit host toolchains by specifying a ``host=x86``
or ``host=x64`` value in the ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` option.
CMake provides the selected toolchain architecture preference in this
variable (``x86``, ``x64``, or empty).

CMAKE_VS_PLATFORM_TOOLSET_VERSION
---------------------------------

Visual Studio Platform Toolset version.

The :ref:`Visual Studio Generators` for VS 2017 and above allow to
select minor versions of the same toolset. The toolset version number
may be specified by a field in ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_TOOLSET`` of
the form ``version=14.11``. If none is specified CMake will choose a default
toolset. The value may be empty if no minor version was selected and the
default is used.

CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION
----------------------------------------

Visual Studio Windows Target Platform Version.

When targeting Windows 10 and above Visual Studio 2015 and above support
specification of a target Windows version to select a corresponding SDK.
The ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` variable may be set to specify a
version.  Otherwise CMake computes a default version based on the Windows
SDK versions available.  The chosen Windows target version number is provided
in ``CMAKE_VS_WINDOWS_TARGET_PLATFORM_VERSION``.  If no Windows 10 SDK
is available this value will be empty.

One may set a ``CMAKE_WINDOWS_KITS_10_DIR`` *environment variable*
to an absolute path to tell CMake to look for Windows 10 SDKs in
a custom location.  The specified directory is expected to contain
``Include/10.0.*`` directories.

CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME
---------------------------

If enabled, the ``Xcode`` generator will generate schema files.  These
are useful to invoke analyze, archive, build-for-testing and test
actions from the command line.

This variable initializes the
``XCODE_GENERATE_SCHEME``
target property on all targets.

CMAKE_XCODE_PLATFORM_TOOLSET
----------------------------

Xcode compiler selection.

``Xcode`` supports selection of a compiler from one of the installed
toolsets.  CMake provides the name of the chosen toolset in this
variable, if any is explicitly selected (e.g.  via the ``cmake(1)``
``-T`` option).

<PROJECT-NAME>_BINARY_DIR
-------------------------

Top level binary directory for the named project.

A variable is created with the name used in the ``project()`` command,
and is the binary directory for the project.  This can be useful when
``add_subdirectory()`` is used to connect several projects.

<PROJECT-NAME>_DESCRIPTION
--------------------------

Value given to the ``DESCRIPTION`` option of the most recent call to the
``project()`` command with project name ``<PROJECT-NAME>``, if any.

<PROJECT-NAME>_HOMEPAGE_URL
---------------------------

Value given to the ``HOMEPAGE_URL`` option of the most recent call to the
``project()`` command with project name ``<PROJECT-NAME>``, if any.

<PROJECT-NAME>_SOURCE_DIR
-------------------------

Top level source directory for the named project.

A variable is created with the name used in the ``project()`` command,
and is the source directory for the project.  This can be useful when
``add_subdirectory()`` is used to connect several projects.

<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION
----------------------

Value given to the ``VERSION`` option of the most recent call to the
``project()`` command with project name ``<PROJECT-NAME>``, if any.

See also the component-wise version variables
``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR``,
``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MINOR``,
``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_PATCH``, and
``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_TWEAK``.

<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MAJOR
----------------------------

First version number component of the ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_MINOR
----------------------------

Second version number component of the ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_PATCH
----------------------------

Third version number component of the ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION_TWEAK
----------------------------

Fourth version number component of the ``<PROJECT-NAME>_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
------------------

Full path to build directory for project.

This is the binary directory of the most recent ``project()`` command.

PROJECT_DESCRIPTION
-------------------

Short project description given to the project command.

This is the description given to the most recently called ``project()``
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the description
of the top level project, see the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_DESCRIPTION``
variable.

PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL
--------------------

The homepage URL of the project.

This is the homepage URL given to the most recently called ``project()``
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the homepage URL
of the top level project, see the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL``
variable.

PROJECT_NAME
------------

Name of the project given to the project command.

This is the name given to the most recently called ``project()``
command in the current directory scope or above.  To obtain the name of
the top level project, see the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME`` variable.

PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR
------------------

Top level source directory for the current project.

This is the source directory of the most recent ``project()`` command.

PROJECT_VERSION
---------------

Value given to the ``VERSION`` option of the most recent call to the
``project()`` command, if any.

See also the component-wise version variables
``PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR``,
``PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR``,
``PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH``, and
``PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK``.

PROJECT_VERSION_MAJOR
---------------------

First version number component of the ``PROJECT_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

PROJECT_VERSION_MINOR
---------------------

Second version number component of the ``PROJECT_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

PROJECT_VERSION_PATCH
---------------------

Third version number component of the ``PROJECT_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

PROJECT_VERSION_TWEAK
---------------------

Fourth version number component of the ``PROJECT_VERSION``
variable as set by the ``project()`` command.

Variables that Change Behavior
==============================

BUILD_SHARED_LIBS
-----------------

Global flag to cause ``add_library()`` to create shared libraries if on.

If present and true, this will cause all libraries to be built shared
unless the library was explicitly added as a static library.  This
variable is often added to projects as an ``option()`` so that each user
of a project can decide if they want to build the project using shared or
static libraries.

CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
--------------------------------

List of files which have been installed using an ``ABSOLUTE DESTINATION`` path.

This variable is defined by CMake-generated ``cmake_install.cmake``
scripts.  It can be used (read-only) by programs or scripts that
source those install scripts.  This is used by some CPack generators
(e.g.  RPM).

CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH
--------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for macOS application bundles used by the ``find_program()``, and
``find_package()`` commands.

CMAKE_AUTOMOC_RELAXED_MODE
--------------------------

Switch between strict and relaxed automoc mode.

By default, ``AUTOMOC`` behaves exactly as described in the
documentation of the ``AUTOMOC`` target property.  When set to
``TRUE``, it accepts more input and tries to find the correct input file for
``moc`` even if it differs from the documented behaviour.  In this mode it
e.g.  also checks whether a header file is intended to be processed by moc
when a ``"foo.moc"`` file has been included.

Relaxed mode has to be enabled for KDE4 compatibility.

CMAKE_BACKWARDS_COMPATIBILITY
-----------------------------

Deprecated.  See CMake Policy ``CMP0001`` documentation.

CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE
----------------

Specifies the build type on single-configuration generators.

This statically specifies what build type (configuration) will be
built in this build tree.  Possible values are empty, ``Debug``, ``Release``,
``RelWithDebInfo``, ``MinSizeRel``, ...  This variable is only meaningful to
single-configuration generators (such as :ref:`Makefile Generators` and
``Ninja``) i.e.  those which choose a single configuration when CMake
runs to generate a build tree as opposed to multi-configuration generators
which offer selection of the build configuration within the generated build
environment.  There are many per-config properties and variables
(usually following clean ``SOME_VAR_<CONFIG>`` order conventions), such as
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``, specified as uppercase:
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL|...]``.  For example,
in a build tree configured to build type ``Debug``, CMake will see to
having ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG`` settings get
added to the ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` settings.  See
also ``CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES``.

CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_COMPILER_ID
----------------------------

Change the compiler id in the generated CodeBlocks project files.

CodeBlocks uses its own compiler id string which differs from
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID``.  If this variable is left empty,
CMake tries to recognize the CodeBlocks compiler id automatically.
Otherwise the specified string is used in the CodeBlocks project file.
See the CodeBlocks documentation for valid compiler id strings.

Other IDEs like QtCreator that also use the CodeBlocks generator may ignore
this setting.

CMAKE_CODEBLOCKS_EXCLUDE_EXTERNAL_FILES
---------------------------------------

Change the way the CodeBlocks generator creates project files.

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` the generator excludes from
the project file any files that are located outside the project root.

CMAKE_CODELITE_USE_TARGETS
--------------------------

Change the way the CodeLite generator creates projectfiles.

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` at the end of the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, the generator creates projectfiles based on targets
rather than projects.

CMAKE_COLOR_MAKEFILE
--------------------

Enables color output when using the :ref:`Makefile Generators`.

When enabled, the generated Makefiles will produce colored output.
Default is ``ON``.

CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES
-------------------------

Specifies the available build types on multi-config generators.

This specifies what build types (configurations) will be available
such as ``Debug``, ``Release``, ``RelWithDebInfo`` etc.  This has reasonable
defaults on most platforms, but can be extended to provide other build
types.  See also ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` for details of managing
configuration data, and ``CMAKE_CFG_INTDIR``.

CMAKE_DEBUG_TARGET_PROPERTIES
-----------------------------

Enables tracing output for target properties.

This variable can be populated with a list of properties to generate
debug output for when evaluating target properties.  Currently it can
only be used when evaluating:

* ``AUTOUIC_OPTIONS``
* ``COMPILE_DEFINITIONS``
* ``COMPILE_FEATURES``
* ``COMPILE_OPTIONS``
* ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``
* ``LINK_DIRECTORIES``
* ``LINK_OPTIONS``
* ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE``
* ``SOURCES``

target properties and any other property listed in
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING`` and other
``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_`` properties.  It outputs an origin for each entry
in the target property.  Default is unset.

CMAKE_DEPENDS_IN_PROJECT_ONLY
-----------------------------

When set to ``TRUE`` in a directory, the build system produced by the
:ref:`Makefile Generators` is set up to only consider dependencies on source
files that appear either in the source or in the binary directories.  Changes
to source files outside of these directories will not cause rebuilds.

This should be used carefully in cases where some source files are picked up
through external headers during the build.

CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>
----------------------------------------

Variable for disabling ``find_package()`` calls.

Every non-``REQUIRED`` ``find_package()`` call in a project can be
disabled by setting the variable
``CMAKE_DISABLE_FIND_PACKAGE_<PackageName>`` to ``TRUE``.
This can be used to build a project without an optional package,
although that package is installed.

This switch should be used during the initial CMake run.  Otherwise if
the package has already been found in a previous CMake run, the
variables which have been stored in the cache will still be there.  In
that case it is recommended to remove the cache variables for this
package from the cache using the cache editor or ``cmake(1)`` ``-U``

CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_LINKED_RESOURCES
---------------------------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
``cmake-generators(7)``.

The Eclipse project generator generates so-called linked resources
e.g. to the subproject root dirs in the source tree or to the source files
of targets.
This can be disabled by setting this variable to FALSE.

CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT
-------------------------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
``cmake-generators(7)``.

If this variable is set to TRUE, the Eclipse project generator will generate
an Eclipse project in ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` . This project can then
be used in Eclipse e.g. for the version control functionality.
``CMAKE_ECLIPSE_GENERATE_SOURCE_PROJECT`` defaults to FALSE; so
nothing is written into the source directory.

CMAKE_ECLIPSE_MAKE_ARGUMENTS
----------------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
``cmake-generators(7)``.

This variable holds arguments which are used when Eclipse invokes the make
tool. By default it is initialized to hold flags to enable parallel builds
(using -j typically).

CMAKE_ECLIPSE_RESOURCE_ENCODING
-------------------------------

This cache variable tells the ``Eclipse CDT4`` project generator
to set the resource encoding to the given value in generated project files.
If no value is given, no encoding will be set.

CMAKE_ECLIPSE_VERSION
---------------------

This cache variable is used by the Eclipse project generator.  See
``cmake-generators(7)``.

When using the Eclipse project generator, CMake tries to find the Eclipse
executable and detect the version of it. Depending on the version it finds,
some features are enabled or disabled. If CMake doesn't find
Eclipse, it assumes the oldest supported version, Eclipse Callisto (3.2).

CMAKE_ERROR_DEPRECATED
----------------------

Whether to issue errors for deprecated functionality.

If ``TRUE``, use of deprecated functionality will issue fatal errors.
If this variable is not set, CMake behaves as if it were set to ``FALSE``.

CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
-------------------------------------------

Ask ``cmake_install.cmake`` script to error out as soon as a file with
absolute ``INSTALL DESTINATION`` is encountered.

The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  This variable is used by CMake-generated
``cmake_install.cmake`` scripts.  If one sets this variable to ``ON`` while
running the script, it may get fatal error messages from the script.

CMAKE_EXECUTE_PROCESS_COMMAND_ECHO
----------------------------------

If this variable is set to ``STDERR``, ``STDOUT`` or ``NONE`` then commands
in ``execute_process()`` calls will be printed to either stderr or
stdout or not at all.

CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS
-----------------------------

Enable/Disable output of compile commands during generation.

If enabled, generates a ``compile_commands.json`` file containing the exact
compiler calls for all translation units of the project in machine-readable
form.  The format of the JSON file looks like:

 [
   {
     "directory": "/home/user/development/project",
     "command": "/usr/bin/c++ ... -c ../foo/foo.cc",
     "file": "../foo/foo.cc"
   },

   ...

   {
     "directory": "/home/user/development/project",
     "command": "/usr/bin/c++ ... -c ../foo/bar.cc",
     "file": "../foo/bar.cc"
   }
 ]

.. note::
  This option is implemented only by :ref:`Makefile Generators`
  and the ``Ninja``.  It is ignored on other generators.

  This option currently does not work well in combination with
  the ``UNITY_BUILD`` target property or the
  ``CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD`` variable.

CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
-----------------------------

Enables the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command when ``CMP0090``
is set to ``NEW``.

The ``export(PACKAGE)`` command does nothing by default.  In some cases
it is desirable to write to the user package registry, so the
``CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable may be set to enable it.

If ``CMP0090`` is *not* set to ``NEW`` this variable does nothing, and
the ``CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable controls the behavior
instead.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.

CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
--------------------------------

Disable the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command when ``CMP0090``
is not set to ``NEW``.

In some cases, for example for packaging and for system wide
installations, it is not desirable to write the user package registry.
If the ``CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable is enabled,
the ``export(PACKAGE)`` command will do nothing.

If ``CMP0090`` is set to ``NEW`` this variable does nothing, and the
``CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable controls the behavior
instead.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.

CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE
--------------------

This variable affects how ``find_*`` commands choose between
macOS Application Bundles and unix-style package components.

On Darwin or systems supporting macOS Application Bundles, the
``CMAKE_FIND_APPBUNDLE`` variable can be set to empty or
one of the following:

``FIRST``
  Try to find application bundles before standard programs.
  This is the default on Darwin.

``LAST``
  Try to find application bundles after standard programs.

``ONLY``
  Only try to find application bundles.

``NEVER``
  Never try to find application bundles.

CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK
--------------------

This variable affects how ``find_*`` commands choose between
macOS Frameworks and unix-style package components.

On Darwin or systems supporting macOS Frameworks, the
``CMAKE_FIND_FRAMEWORK`` variable can be set to empty or
one of the following:

``FIRST``
  Try to find frameworks before standard libraries or headers.
  This is the default on Darwin.

``LAST``
  Try to find frameworks after standard libraries or headers.

``ONLY``
  Only try to find frameworks.

``NEVER``
  Never try to find frameworks.

CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_CUSTOM_LIB_SUFFIX
------------------------------------

Specify a ``<suffix>`` to tell the ``find_library()`` command to
search in a ``lib<suffix>`` directory before each ``lib`` directory that
would normally be searched.

This overrides the behavior of related global properties:

* ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB32_PATHS``
* ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIB64_PATHS``
* ``FIND_LIBRARY_USE_LIBX32_PATHS``

CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_PREFIXES
---------------------------

Prefixes to prepend when looking for libraries.

This specifies what prefixes to add to library names when the
``find_library()`` command looks for libraries.  On UNIX systems this is
typically ``lib``, meaning that when trying to find the ``foo`` library it
will look for ``libfoo``.

CMAKE_FIND_LIBRARY_SUFFIXES
---------------------------

Suffixes to append when looking for libraries.

This specifies what suffixes to add to library names when the
``find_library()`` command looks for libraries.  On Windows systems this
is typically ``.lib`` and ``.dll``, meaning that when trying to find the
``foo`` library it will look for ``foo.dll`` etc.

CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX
----------------------------

Exclude the values of the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` and
``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` variables from
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``.  CMake adds these project-destination
prefixes to ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`` by default in order to
support building a series of dependent packages and installing them into
a common prefix.  Set ``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` to ``TRUE``
to suppress this behavior.

The ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`` is initialized on the first call to a
``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command.  Therefore one must
set ``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` before this in order to take effect.  A
user may set the variable as a cache entry on the command line to achieve this.

Note that the prefix(es) may still be searched for other reasons, such as being
the same prefix as the CMake installation, or for being a built-in system
prefix.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
--------------------------------------

By default this variable is not set. If neither
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` nor
``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is set, then
``find_package()`` will use the :ref:`User Package Registry`
unless the ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` option is provided.

``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is ignored if
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` is set.

In some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it
is not desirable to use the :ref:`User Package Registry` when searching
for packages. If the ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``
variable is ``TRUE``, all the ``find_package()`` commands will skip
the :ref:`User Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
---------------------------------------------

Skip :ref:`System Package Registry` in ``find_package()`` calls.

In some cases, it is not desirable to use the
:ref:`System Package Registry` when searching for packages. If the
``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable is
enabled, all the ``find_package()`` commands will skip
the :ref:`System Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry`.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG
---------------------------------

Tell ``find_package()`` to try "Config" mode before "Module" mode if no
mode was specified.

The command ``find_package()`` operates without an explicit mode when
the reduced signature is used without the ``MODULE`` option. In this case,
by default, CMake first tries Module mode by searching for a
``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module.  If it fails, CMake then searches for the package
using Config mode.

Set ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG`` to ``TRUE`` to tell
``find_package()`` to first search using Config mode before falling back
to Module mode.

This variable may be useful when a developer has compiled a custom version of
a common library and wishes to link it to a dependent project.  If this
variable is set to ``TRUE``, it would prevent a dependent project's call
to ``find_package()`` from selecting the default library located by the
system's ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module before finding the developer's custom
built library.

Once this variable is set, it is the responsibility of the exported
``<pkg>Config.cmake`` files to provide the same result variables as the
``Find<pkg>.cmake`` modules so that dependent projects can use them
interchangeably.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_RESOLVE_SYMLINKS
-----------------------------------

Set to ``TRUE`` to tell ``find_package()`` calls to resolve symbolic
links in the value of ``<PackageName>_DIR``.

This is helpful in use cases where the package search path points at a
proxy directory in which symlinks to the real package locations appear.
This is not enabled by default because there are also common use cases
in which the symlinks should be preserved.

CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE
---------------------------------

Tell ``find_package()`` to warn if called without an explicit mode.

If ``find_package()`` is called without an explicit mode option
(``MODULE``, ``CONFIG``, or ``NO_MODULE``) and no ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module
is in ``CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`` then CMake implicitly assumes that the
caller intends to search for a package configuration file.  If no package
configuration file is found then the wording of the failure message
must account for both the case that the package is really missing and
the case that the project has a bug and failed to provide the intended
Find module.  If instead the caller specifies an explicit mode option
then the failure message can be more specific.

Set ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_WARN_NO_MODULE`` to ``TRUE`` to tell
``find_package()`` to warn when it implicitly assumes Config mode.  This
helps developers enforce use of an explicit mode in all calls to
``find_package()`` within a project.

This variable has no effect if ``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_PREFER_CONFIG`` is
set to ``TRUE``.

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH
--------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of root paths to search on the filesystem.

This variable is most useful when cross-compiling. CMake uses the paths in
this list as alternative roots to find filesystem items with
``find_package()``, ``find_library()`` etc.

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_INCLUDE
---------------------------------

This variable controls whether the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` and
``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` are used by ``find_file()`` and ``find_path()``.

If set to ``ONLY``, then only the roots in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
will be searched. If set to ``NEVER``, then the roots in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to ``BOTH``, then the host system paths and the
paths in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be searched.

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_LIBRARY
---------------------------------

This variable controls whether the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` and
``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` are used by ``find_library()``.

If set to ``ONLY``, then only the roots in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
will be searched. If set to ``NEVER``, then the roots in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to ``BOTH``, then the host system paths and the
paths in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be searched.

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PACKAGE
---------------------------------

This variable controls whether the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` and
``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` are used by ``find_package()``.

If set to ``ONLY``, then only the roots in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
will be searched. If set to ``NEVER``, then the roots in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to ``BOTH``, then the host system paths and the
paths in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be searched.

CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH_MODE_PROGRAM
---------------------------------

This variable controls whether the ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` and
``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` are used by ``find_program()``.

If set to ``ONLY``, then only the roots in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH``
will be searched. If set to ``NEVER``, then the roots in
``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be ignored and only the host system
root will be used. If set to ``BOTH``, then the host system paths and the
paths in ``CMAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH`` will be searched.

CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH
-------------------------------------

Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to
search paths provided by cmake-specific environment variables:

* ``find_program()``
* ``find_library()``
* ``find_file()``
* ``find_path()``
* ``find_package()``

This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

By default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having
a value of ``TRUE``.  Explicit options given to the above commands
take precedence over this variable.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``,
and ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH
-------------------------

Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to
search paths provided by cmake-specific cache variables:

* ``find_program()``
* ``find_library()``
* ``find_file()``
* ``find_path()``
* ``find_package()``

This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

By default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having
a value of ``TRUE``.  Explicit options given to the above commands
take precedence over this variable.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``,
and ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH
--------------------------------

Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to
search paths provided by platform-specific cmake variables:

* ``find_program()``
* ``find_library()``
* ``find_file()``
* ``find_path()``
* ``find_package()``

This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

By default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having
a value of ``TRUE``.  Explicit options given to the above commands
take precedence over this variable.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``,
and ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY
-------------------------------

Controls the default behavior of the ``find_package()`` command for
whether or not to search paths provided by the :ref:`User Package Registry`.

By default this variable is not set and the behavior will fall back
to that determined by the deprecated
``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable.  If that is
also not set, then ``find_package()`` will use the
:ref:`User Package Registry` unless the ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` option
is provided.

This variable takes precedence over
``CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` when both are set.

In some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it
is not desirable to use the :ref:`User Package Registry` when searching
for packages.  If the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``
variable is ``FALSE``, all the ``find_package()`` commands will skip
the :ref:`User Package Registry` as if they were called with the
``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument.

See also :ref:`Disabling the Package Registry` and the
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
and ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH
--------------------------------

Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to
search paths provided by ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables:

* ``find_program()``
* ``find_library()``
* ``find_file()``
* ``find_path()``
* ``find_package()``

By default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having
a value of ``TRUE``.  Explicit options given to the above commands
take precedence over this variable.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
and ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variables.

CMAKE_FIND_USE_SYSTEM_ENVIRONMENT_PATH
--------------------------------------

Controls the default behavior of the following commands for whether or not to
search paths provided by standard system environment variables:

* ``find_program()``
* ``find_library()``
* ``find_file()``
* ``find_path()``
* ``find_package()``

This is useful in cross-compiling environments.

By default this variable is not set, which is equivalent to it having
a value of ``TRUE``.  Explicit options given to the above commands
take precedence over this variable.

See also the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_ENVIRONMENT_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_CMAKE_SYSTEM_PATH``,
``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY``,
and ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_ROOT_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH
--------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for macOS frameworks used by the ``find_library()``,
``find_package()``, ``find_path()``, and ``find_file()``
commands.

CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH
-----------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by
the ``find_program()``, ``find_library()``, ``find_file()``,
and ``find_path()`` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling
environments where some system directories contain incompatible but
possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster
environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing
libraries meant for the front-end machine.

By default this is empty; it is intended to be set by the project.
Note that ``CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH`` takes a list of directory names, *not*
a list of prefixes.  To ignore paths under prefixes (``bin``, ``include``,
``lib``, etc.), specify them explicitly.

See also the ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``, ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``,
``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``, and ``CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE
--------------------------------

Whether to append or prepend directories by default in
``include_directories()``.

This variable affects the default behavior of the ``include_directories()``
command.  Setting this variable to ``ON`` is equivalent to using the ``BEFORE``
option in all uses of that command.

CMAKE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES_PROJECT_BEFORE
----------------------------------------

Whether to force prepending of project include directories.

This variable affects the order of include directories generated in compiler
command lines.  If set to ``ON``, it causes the ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``
and the ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`` to appear first.

CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH
------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``find_file()`` and ``find_path()`` commands.  By default it
is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.  See also
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH`` and ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.

CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_COMPONENT_NAME
------------------------------------

Default component used in ``install()`` commands.

If an ``install()`` command is used without the ``COMPONENT`` argument,
these files will be grouped into a default component.  The name of this
default install component will be taken from this variable.  It
defaults to ``Unspecified``.

CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------

Default permissions for directories created implicitly during installation
of files by ``install()`` and ``file(INSTALL)``.

If ``make install`` is invoked and directories are implicitly created they
get permissions set by ``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS``
variable or platform specific default permissions if the variable is not set.

Implicitly created directories are created if they are not explicitly installed
by ``install()`` command but are needed to install a file on a certain
path. Example of such locations are directories created due to the setting of
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

Expected content of the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS``
variable is a list of permissions that can be used by ``install()`` command
`PERMISSIONS` section.

Example usage:

::

 set(CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
      OWNER_READ
      OWNER_WRITE
      OWNER_EXECUTE
      GROUP_READ
    )

CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE
---------------------

Specify verbosity of installation script code generated by the
``install()`` command (using the ``file(INSTALL)`` command).
For paths that are newly installed or updated, installation
may print lines like::

 -- Installing: /some/destination/path

For paths that are already up to date, installation may print
lines like::

 -- Up-to-date: /some/destination/path

The ``CMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE`` variable may be set to control
which messages are printed:

``ALWAYS``
  Print both ``Installing`` and ``Up-to-date`` messages.

``LAZY``
  Print ``Installing`` but not ``Up-to-date`` messages.

``NEVER``
  Print neither ``Installing`` nor ``Up-to-date`` messages.

Other values have undefined behavior and may not be diagnosed.

If this variable is not set, the default behavior is ``ALWAYS``.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
--------------------

Install directory used by ``install()``.

If ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is built, this directory is
prepended onto all install directories.  This variable defaults to
``/usr/local`` on UNIX and ``c:/Program Files/${PROJECT_NAME}`` on Windows.
See ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT`` for how a
project might choose its own default.

On UNIX one can use the ``DESTDIR`` mechanism in order to relocate the
whole installation. See ``DESTDIR`` for more information.

The installation prefix is also added to ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``
so that ``find_package()``, ``find_program()``,
``find_library()``, ``find_path()``, and ``find_file()``
will search the prefix for other software.

.. note::

  Use the ``GNUInstallDirs`` module to provide GNU-style
  options for the layout of directories within the installation.

CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT
-------------------------------------------

CMake sets this variable to a ``TRUE`` value when the
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` has just been initialized to
its default value, typically on the first run of CMake within
a new build tree.  This can be used by project code to change
the default without overriding a user-provided value:

 if(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX_INITIALIZED_TO_DEFAULT)
   set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "/my/default" CACHE PATH "..." FORCE)
 endif()

CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH
------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``find_library()`` command.  By default it is empty, it is
intended to be set by the project.  See also
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH`` and ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.

CMAKE_LINK_DIRECTORIES_BEFORE
-----------------------------

Whether to append or prepend directories by default in
``link_directories()``.

This variable affects the default behavior of the ``link_directories()``
command.  Setting this variable to ``ON`` is equivalent to using the ``BEFORE``
option in all uses of that command.

CMAKE_MFC_FLAG
--------------

Use the MFC library for an executable or dll.

Enables the use of the Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC).
It should be set to ``1`` for the static MFC library, and
``2`` for the shared MFC library.  This is used in Visual Studio
project files.

Usage example:

 add_definitions(-D_AFXDLL)
 set(CMAKE_MFC_FLAG 2)
 add_executable(CMakeSetup WIN32 ${SRCS})

CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH
-----------------------------

Maximum recursion depth for CMake scripts. It is intended to be set on the
command line with ``-DCMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH=<x>``, or within
``CMakeLists.txt`` by projects that require a large recursion depth. Projects
that set this variable should provide the user with a way to override it. For
example:

 # About to perform deeply recursive actions
 if(NOT CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH)
   set(CMAKE_MAXIMUM_RECURSION_DEPTH 2000)
 endif()

If it is not set, or is set to a non-integer value, a sensible default limit is
used. If the recursion limit is reached, the script terminates immediately with
a fatal error.

Calling any of the following commands increases the recursion depth:

* ``include()``
* ``find_package()``
* ``add_subdirectory()``
* ``try_compile()``
* ``ctest_read_custom_files()``
* ``ctest_run_script()`` (unless ``NEW_PROCESS`` is specified)
* User-defined ``function()``'s and ``macro()``'s (note that
  ``function()`` and ``macro()`` themselves don't increase recursion
  depth)
* Reading or writing variables that are being watched by a
  ``variable_watch()``

CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
-----------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for CMake modules to be loaded by the ``include()`` or
``find_package()`` commands before checking the default modules that come
with CMake.  By default it is empty, it is intended to be set by the project.

CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>
------------------------------

Default for CMake Policy ``CMP<NNNN>`` when it is otherwise left unset.

Commands ``cmake_minimum_required(VERSION)`` and
``cmake_policy(VERSION)`` by default leave policies introduced after
the given version unset.  Set ``CMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>`` to ``OLD``
or ``NEW`` to specify the default for policy ``CMP<NNNN>``, where ``<NNNN>``
is the policy number.

This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code; use
``cmake_policy(SET)`` instead.  Users running CMake may set this
variable in the cache (e.g. ``-DCMAKE_POLICY_DEFAULT_CMP<NNNN>=<OLD|NEW>``)
to set a policy not otherwise set by the project.  Set to ``OLD`` to quiet a
policy warning while using old behavior or to ``NEW`` to try building the
project with new behavior.

CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>
------------------------------

Explicitly enable or disable the warning when CMake Policy ``CMP<NNNN>``
is not set.  This is meaningful only for the few policies that do not
warn by default:

* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0025`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0025``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0047`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0047``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0056`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0056``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0060`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0060``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0065``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0066`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0066``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0067`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0067``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0082`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0082``.
* ``CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0089`` controls the warning for
  policy ``CMP0089``.

This variable should not be set by a project in CMake code.  Project
developers running CMake may set this variable in their cache to
enable the warning (e.g. ``-DCMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>=ON``).
Alternatively, running ``cmake(1)`` with the ``--debug-output``,
``--trace``, or ``--trace-expand`` option will also enable the warning.

CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH
-----------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying installation
*prefixes* to be searched by the ``find_package()``,
``find_program()``, ``find_library()``, ``find_file()``, and
``find_path()`` commands.  Each command will add appropriate
subdirectories (like ``bin``, ``lib``, or ``include``) as specified in its own
documentation.

By default this is empty.  It is intended to be set by the project.

See also ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``, ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH``, and
``CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH``.

CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH
------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``find_program()`` command.  By default it is empty, it is
intended to be set by the project.  See also
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH`` and ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH``.

CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE
---------------------

A CMake language file or module to be included as the last step of all
``project()`` command calls.  This is intended for injecting custom code
into project builds without modifying their source.

See also the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE`` and
``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`` variables.

CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE
----------------------------

A CMake language file or module to be included as the first step of all
``project()`` command calls.  This is intended for injecting custom code
into project builds without modifying their source.

See also the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE`` and
``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE`` variables.

CMAKE_PROJECT_<PROJECT-NAME>_INCLUDE
------------------------------------

A CMake language file or module to be included as the last step of any
``project()`` command calls that specify ``<PROJECT-NAME>`` as the project
name.  This is intended for injecting custom code into project builds without
modifying their source.

See also the ``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE`` and
``CMAKE_PROJECT_INCLUDE_BEFORE`` variables.

CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY
---------------------------------

Don't make the ``install`` target depend on the ``all`` target.

By default, the ``install`` target depends on the ``all`` target.  This
has the effect, that when ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is
built, first the ``all`` target is built, then the installation starts.
If ``CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY`` is set to ``TRUE``, this
dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately,
independent from whether the project has been completely built or not.

CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX
--------------------

This variable may be set to a path to install to when cross-compiling. This can
be useful if the path in ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` is read-only, or otherwise
should remain pristine.

The ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX`` location is also used as a search prefix
by the ``find_*`` commands. This can be controlled by setting the
``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.

If any ``RPATH``/``RUNPATH`` entries passed to the linker contain the
``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``, the matching path fragments are replaced
with the ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``.

CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
---------------------------------

This variable contains a list of env vars as a list of tokens with the
syntax ``var=value``.

Example:

 set(CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
    "FOO=FOO1\;FOO2\;FOON"
    "BAR=BAR1\;BAR2\;BARN"
    "BAZ=BAZ1\;BAZ2\;BAZN"
    "FOOBAR=FOOBAR1\;FOOBAR2\;FOOBARN"
    "VALID="
    )

In case of malformed variables CMake will fail:

 set(CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_ENV_SETTINGS
     "THIS_IS_NOT_VALID"
     )

CMAKE_SUBLIME_TEXT_2_EXCLUDE_BUILD_TREE
---------------------------------------

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` at the end of the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, the ``Sublime Text 2`` extra generator
excludes the build tree from the ``.sublime-project`` if it is inside the
source tree.

CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION
---------------------------

If ``CMAKE_SUPPRESS_REGENERATION`` is ``OFF``, which is default, then CMake
adds a special target on which all other targets depend that checks the build
system and optionally re-runs CMake to regenerate the build system when
the target specification source changes.

If this variable evaluates to ``ON`` at the end of the top-level
``CMakeLists.txt`` file, CMake will not add the regeneration target to the
build system or perform any build system checks.

CMAKE_SYSROOT
-------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag.

The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` content is passed to the compiler in the ``--sysroot``
flag, if supported.  The path is also stripped from the ``RPATH``/``RUNPATH``
if necessary on installation.  The ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` is also used to prefix
paths searched by the ``find_*`` commands.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` variable.

See also the ``CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE`` and
``CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK`` variables.

CMAKE_SYSROOT_COMPILE
---------------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag when compiling source
files.  This is the same as ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` but is used only for
compiling sources and not linking.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` variable.

CMAKE_SYSROOT_LINK
------------------

Path to pass to the compiler in the ``--sysroot`` flag when linking.  This is
the same as ``CMAKE_SYSROOT`` but is used only for linking and not
compiling sources.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` variable.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_APPBUNDLE_PATH
---------------------------

Search path for macOS application bundles used by the ``find_program()``,
and ``find_package()`` commands.  By default it contains the standard
directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be modified by
the project, use ``CMAKE_APPBUNDLE_PATH`` for this.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_FRAMEWORK_PATH
---------------------------

Search path for macOS frameworks used by the ``find_library()``,
``find_package()``, ``find_path()``, and ``find_file()``
commands.  By default it contains the standard directories for the
current system.  It is *not* intended to be modified by the project,
use ``CMAKE_FRAMEWORK_PATH`` for this.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH
------------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by
the ``find_program()``, ``find_library()``, ``find_file()``,
and ``find_path()`` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling
environments where some system directories contain incompatible but
possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster
environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing
libraries meant for the front-end machine.

By default this contains a list of directories containing incompatible
binaries for the host system.  See the ``CMAKE_IGNORE_PATH`` variable
that is intended to be set by the project.

See also the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``,
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH``,
and ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH`` variables.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH
-------------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``find_file()`` and ``find_path()`` commands.  By default
this contains the standard directories for the current system.  It is *not*
intended to be modified by the project; use ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_PATH`` for
this.  See also ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH
-------------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``find_library()`` command.  By default this contains the
standard directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be
modified by the project; use ``CMAKE_LIBRARY_PATH`` for this.
See also ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH
------------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying installation
*prefixes* to be searched by the ``find_package()``,
``find_program()``, ``find_library()``, ``find_file()``, and
``find_path()`` commands.  Each command will add appropriate
subdirectories (like ``bin``, ``lib``, or ``include``) as specified in its own
documentation.

By default this contains the standard directories for the current system, the
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX``, and the ``CMAKE_STAGING_PREFIX``.
The installation and staging prefixes may be excluded by setting
the ``CMAKE_FIND_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX`` variable.

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH`` is *not* intended to be modified by the project;
use ``CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`` for this.

See also ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_PATH``,
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_LIBRARY_PATH``, ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH``,
and ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_IGNORE_PATH``.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROGRAM_PATH
-------------------------

:ref:`Semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories specifying a search path
for the ``find_program()`` command.  By default this contains the
standard directories for the current system.  It is *not* intended to be
modified by the project; use ``CMAKE_PROGRAM_PATH`` for this.
See also ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PREFIX_PATH``.

CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE
------------------------------

Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information.

CMake loads the specified file while enabling support for each
language from either the ``project()`` or ``enable_language()``
commands.  It is loaded after CMake's builtin compiler and platform information
modules have been loaded but before the information is used.  The file
may set platform information variables to override CMake's defaults.

This feature is intended for use only in overriding information
variables that must be set before CMake builds its first test project
to check that the compiler for a language works.  It should not be
used to load a file in cases that a normal ``include()`` will work.  Use
it only as a last resort for behavior that cannot be achieved any
other way.  For example, one may set the
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_INIT`` variable
to change the default value used to initialize the
``CMAKE_C_FLAGS`` variable
before it is cached.  The override file should NOT be used to set anything
that could be set after languages are enabled, such as variables like
``CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` that affect the placement of
binaries.  Information set in the file will be used for ``try_compile()``
and ``try_run()`` builds too.

CMAKE_WARN_DEPRECATED
---------------------

Whether to issue warnings for deprecated functionality.

If not ``FALSE``, use of deprecated functionality will issue warnings.
If this variable is not set, CMake behaves as if it were set to ``TRUE``.

When running ``cmake(1)``, this option can be enabled with the
``-Wdeprecated`` option, or disabled with the ``-Wno-deprecated`` option.

CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
------------------------------------------

Ask ``cmake_install.cmake`` script to warn each time a file with absolute
``INSTALL DESTINATION`` is encountered.

This variable is used by CMake-generated ``cmake_install.cmake`` scripts.
If one sets this variable to ``ON`` while running the script, it may get
warning messages from the script.

CMAKE_XCODE_GENERATE_TOP_LEVEL_PROJECT_ONLY
-------------------------------------------

If enabled, the ``Xcode`` generator will generate only a
single Xcode project file for the topmost ``project()`` command
instead of generating one for every ``project()`` command.

This could be useful to speed up the CMake generation step for
large projects and to work-around a bug in the ``ZERO_CHECK`` logic.

-------

Set to ``1`` when the target system (``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``) is
``Android``.

APPLE
-----

Set to ``True`` when the target system is an Apple platform
(macOS, iOS, tvOS or watchOS).

BORLAND
-------

``True`` if the Borland compiler is being used.

This is set to ``true`` if the Borland compiler is being used.

CMAKE_CL_64
-----------

Discouraged.  Use ``CMAKE_SIZEOF_VOID_P`` instead.

Set to a true value when using a Microsoft Visual Studio ``cl`` compiler that
*targets* a 64-bit architecture.

CMAKE_COMPILER_2005
-------------------

Using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft

Set to true when using the Visual Studio 2005 compiler from Microsoft.

CMAKE_HOST_APPLE
----------------

``True`` for Apple macOS operating systems.

Set to ``true`` when the host system is Apple macOS.

CMAKE_HOST_SOLARIS
------------------

``True`` for Oracle Solaris operating systems.

Set to ``true`` when the host system is Oracle Solaris.

CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM
-----------------

Composite Name of OS CMake is being run on.

This variable is the composite of ``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`` and
``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION``, e.g.
``${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION}``.  If
``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION`` is not set, then this variable is
the same as ``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME``.

CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME
----------------------

Name of the OS CMake is running on.

On systems that have the uname command, this variable is set to the
output of ``uname -s``.  ``Linux``, ``Windows``, and ``Darwin`` for macOS
are the values found on the big three operating systems.

CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
---------------------------

The name of the CPU CMake is running on.

On systems that support ``uname``, this variable is set to the output of
``uname -p``.  On Windows it is set to the value of the environment variable
``PROCESSOR_ARCHITECTURE``.

CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION
-------------------------

The OS version CMake is running on.

A numeric version string for the system.  On systems that support
``uname``, this variable is set to the output of ``uname -r``. On other
systems this is set to major-minor version numbers.

CMAKE_HOST_UNIX
---------------

``True`` for UNIX and UNIX like operating systems.

Set to ``true`` when the host system is UNIX or UNIX like (i.e.  APPLE and
CYGWIN).

CMAKE_HOST_WIN32
----------------

``True`` if the host system is running Windows, including Windows 64-bit and MSYS.

Set to ``false`` on Cygwin.

CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
--------------------------

Target architecture library directory name, if detected.

This is the value of ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` as detected
for one of the enabled languages.

CMAKE_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE_REGEX
--------------------------------

Regex matching possible target architecture library directory names.

This is used to detect ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE`` from the
implicit linker search path by matching the ``<arch>`` name.

CMAKE_OBJECT_PATH_MAX
---------------------

Maximum object file full-path length allowed by native build tools.

CMake computes for every source file an object file name that is
unique to the source file and deterministic with respect to the full
path to the source file.  This allows multiple source files in a
target to share the same name if they lie in different directories
without rebuilding when one is added or removed.  However, it can
produce long full paths in a few cases, so CMake shortens the path
using a hashing scheme when the full path to an object file exceeds a
limit.  CMake has a built-in limit for each platform that is
sufficient for common tools, but some native tools may have a lower
limit.  This variable may be set to specify the limit explicitly.  The
value must be an integer no less than 128.

CMAKE_SYSTEM
------------

Composite name of operating system CMake is compiling for.

This variable is the composite of ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` and
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION``, e.g.
``${CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME}-${CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION}``.  If
``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` is not set, then this variable is
the same as ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME``.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME
-----------------

The name of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` variable for the OS version.

Note that ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is not set to anything by default when running
in script mode, since it's not building anything.

System Name for Host Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` is by default set to the same value as the
``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable so that the build
targets the host system.

System Name for Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` may be set explicitly when first configuring a new build
tree in order to enable :ref:`cross compiling <Cross Compiling Toolchain>`.
In this case the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` variable must also be
set explicitly.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR
----------------------

The name of the CPU CMake is building for.

This variable is the same as ``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`` if
you build for the host system instead of the target system when
cross compiling.

CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION
--------------------

The version of the operating system for which CMake is to build.
See the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable for the OS name.

System Version for Host Builds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable takes its default value
then ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` is by default set to the same value as the
``CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_VERSION`` variable so that the build targets
the host system version.

In the case of a host build then ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` may be set
explicitly when first configuring a new build tree in order to enable
targeting the build for a different version of the host operating system
than is actually running on the host.  This is allowed and not considered
cross compiling so long as the binaries built for the specified OS version
can still run on the host.

System Version for Cross Compiling
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME`` variable is set explicitly to
enable :ref:`cross compiling <Cross Compiling Toolchain>` then the
value of ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_VERSION`` must also be set explicitly to specify
the target system version.

The default value is ``gnustl_static`` on NDK versions that provide it
and otherwise ``c++_static``.  Note that this default differs from
the native NDK build system because CMake may be used to build projects for
Android that are not natively implemented for it and use the C++ standard
library.

CMAKE_ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY

------------------------------

Use the install path for the ``RPATH``.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the ``RPATH`` when building
executables etc on systems that use ``RPATH``.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install ``RPATH``.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with the install path for the ``RPATH`` and does not need to
be relinked when installed.

CMAKE_COMPILE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
----------------------------------

Output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files
generated by the compiler while building source files.

This variable is used to initialize the

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``.

CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
---------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
``CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT``.

CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET
---------------------------

Switch to enable generation of a global ``autogen`` target.

When ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET`` is enabled, a custom target
``autogen`` is generated.  This target depends on all ``AUTOMOC`` and
``AUTOUIC`` generated ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` targets in the project.
By building the global ``autogen`` target, all ``AUTOMOC`` and
``AUTOUIC`` files in the project will be generated.

The name of the global ``autogen`` target can be changed by setting
``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME``.

By default ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET`` is unset.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

Note
^^^^

``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` targets by default inherit their origin target's
dependencies.  This might result in unintended dependency target
builds when only ``<ORIGIN>_autogen`` targets are built.  A solution is to
disable ``AUTOGEN_ORIGIN_DEPENDS`` on the respective origin targets.

CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME
--------------------------------

Change the name of the global ``autogen`` target.

``autorcc`` is generated. This target depends on all ``AUTORCC``
generated ``<ORIGIN>_arcc_<QRC>`` targets in the project.
By building the global ``autorcc`` target, all ``AUTORCC``
files in the project will be generated.

The name of the global ``autorcc`` target can be changed by setting
``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME``.

By default ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET`` is unset.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME
--------------------------------

Change the name of the global ``autorcc`` target.

When ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET`` is enabled, a global custom target
named ``autorcc`` is created.  ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTORCC_TARGET_NAME``
allows to set a different name for that target.

By default ``CMAKE_GLOBAL_AUTOGEN_TARGET_NAME`` is unset.

See the ``cmake-qt(7)`` manual for more information on using CMake
with Qt.

CMAKE_GNUtoMS
-------------

Convert GNU import libraries (``.dll.a``) to MS format (``.lib``).

This variable is used to initialize the ``GNUtoMS`` property on
targets when they are created.  See that target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR
-------------------------

Automatically add the current source and build directories to the include path.

If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds
``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR``
to the include path for each directory.  These additional include
directories do not propagate down to subdirectories.  This is useful
mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build
tree are included by files located in the source tree.

By default ``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR`` is ``OFF``.

CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE
--------------------------------------

Automatically add the current source and build directories to the
``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property.

If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds for each shared
library target, static library target, module target and executable
target, ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR`` and
``CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR`` to
the ``INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` target property.  By default
``CMAKE_INCLUDE_CURRENT_DIR_IN_INTERFACE`` is ``OFF``.

-------------------------

Linker flags to be used to create modules.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating a module.

CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a module.

Same as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*`` but used by the linker when creating modules.

CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
---------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file

See also ``CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``.

CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
``CMAKE_MODULE_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT``.

CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH
----------------------

Extra PATH locations that should be used when executing
``add_custom_command()`` or ``add_custom_target()`` when using the
``Visual Studio 9 2008`` (or above) generator. This allows
for running commands and using dll's that the IDE environment is not aware of.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``CMAKE_MSVCIDE_RUN_PATH``
environment variable, if set, and otherwise left empty.

CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY
--------------------------

Select the MSVC runtime library for use by compilers targeting the MSVC ABI.
This variable is used to initialize the ``MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY``
property on all targets as they are created.  It is also propagated by
calls to the ``try_compile()`` command into the test project.

The allowed values are:

``MultiThreaded``
  Compile with ``-MT`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  statically-linked runtime library.
``MultiThreadedDLL``
  Compile with ``-MD`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  dynamically-linked runtime library.
``MultiThreadedDebug``
  Compile with ``-MTd`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  statically-linked runtime library.
``MultiThreadedDebugDLL``
  Compile with ``-MDd`` or equivalent flag(s) to use a multi-threaded
  dynamically-linked runtime library.

The value is ignored on non-MSVC compilers but an unsupported value will
be rejected as an error when using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

The value may also be the empty string (``""``) in which case no runtime
library selection flag will be added explicitly by CMake.  Note that with
:ref:`Visual Studio Generators` the native build system may choose to
add its own default runtime library selection flag.

Use ``generator expressions`` to
support per-configuration specification.  For example, the code:

 set(CMAKE_MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY "MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>")

selects for all following targets a multi-threaded statically-linked runtime
library with or without debug information depending on the configuration.

If this variable is not set then the ``MSVC_RUNTIME_LIBRARY`` target
property will not be set automatically.  If that property is not set then
CMake uses the default value ``MultiThreaded$<$<CONFIG:Debug>:Debug>DLL``
to select a MSVC runtime library.

.. note::

  This variable has effect only when policy ``CMP0091`` is set to ``NEW``
  prior to the first ``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command
  that enables a language using a compiler targeting the MSVC ABI.

CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX
------------------------------

Set output files path prefix for the ``Ninja`` generator.

Every output files listed in the generated ``build.ninja`` will be
prefixed by the contents of this variable (a trailing slash is
appended if missing).  This is useful when the generated ninja file is
meant to be embedded as a ``subninja`` file into a *super* ninja
project.  For example, a ninja build file generated with a command
like::

 cd top-build-dir/sub &&
 cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX=sub/ path/to/source

can be embedded in ``top-build-dir/build.ninja`` with a directive like
this::

 subninja sub/build.ninja

The ``auto-regeneration`` rule in ``top-build-dir/build.ninja`` must have an
order-only dependency on ``sub/build.ninja``.

.. note::
  When ``CMAKE_NINJA_OUTPUT_PATH_PREFIX`` is set, the project generated
  by CMake cannot be used as a standalone project.  No default targets
  are specified.

CMAKE_NO_BUILTIN_CHRPATH
------------------------

Do not use the builtin ELF editor to fix RPATHs on installation.

When an ELF binary needs to have a different RPATH after installation
than it does in the build tree, CMake uses a builtin editor to change
the RPATH in the installed copy.  If this variable is set to true then
CMake will relink the binary before installation instead of using its
builtin editor.

CMAKE_NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED
-----------------------------

Default value for ``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED`` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the ``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED``
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES
-----------------------

Target specific architectures for macOS and iOS.

This variable is used to initialize the ``OSX_ARCHITECTURES``
property on each target as it is created.  See that target property
for additional information.

The value of this variable should be set prior to the first
``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command invocation
because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.
It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree.
This variable should be set as a ``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may
remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name).

Despite the ``OSX`` part in the variable name(s) they apply also to
other SDKs than macOS like iOS, tvOS, or watchOS.

This variable is ignored on platforms other than Apple.

CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET
---------------------------

Specify the minimum version of the target platform (e.g. macOS or iOS)
on which the target binaries are to be deployed.  CMake uses this
variable value for the ``-mmacosx-version-min`` flag or their respective
target platform equivalents.  For older Xcode versions that shipped
multiple macOS SDKs this variable also helps to choose the SDK in case
``CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT`` is unset.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the
``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environment variable, if set,
and otherwise computed based on the host platform.

The value of this variable should be set prior to the first
``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command invocation
because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.
It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree.
This variable should be set as a ``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may
remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name).

Despite the ``OSX`` part in the variable name(s) they apply also to
other SDKs than macOS like iOS, tvOS, or watchOS.

This variable is ignored on platforms other than Apple.

CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT
-----------------

Specify the location or name of the macOS platform SDK to be used.
CMake uses this value to compute the value of the ``-isysroot`` flag
or equivalent and to help the ``find_*`` commands locate files in
the SDK.

If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``SDKROOT``
environment variable, if set, and otherwise computed based on the
``CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` or the host platform.

The value of this variable should be set prior to the first
``project()`` or ``enable_language()`` command invocation
because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags.
It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree.
This variable should be set as a ``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may
remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name).

Despite the ``OSX`` part in the variable name(s) they apply also to
other SDKs than macOS like iOS, tvOS, or watchOS.

This variable is ignored on platforms other than Apple.

CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
--------------------------

Output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files generated by the
linker for executable and shared library targets.

This variable is used to initialize the ``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
-----------------------------------

Per-configuration output directory for MS debug symbol ``.pdb`` files
generated by the linker for executable and shared library targets.

This is a per-configuration version of ``CMAKE_PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``.
This variable is used to initialize the
``PDB_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>``
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE
-------------------------------

Default value for ``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the
``POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE`` property on all the targets.
See that target property for additional information.  If set, it's
value is also used by the ``try_compile()`` command.

CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY
------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>`
target files when built.

This variable is used to initialize the ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``
property on all the targets.  See that target property for additional
information.

CMAKE_RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>
---------------------------------------

Where to put all the :ref:`RUNTIME <Runtime Output Artifacts>`
target files when built for a specific configuration.

This variable is used to initialize the
``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY_<CONFIG>`` property on all the targets.
See that target property for additional information.

CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS
-------------------------

Linker flags to be used to create shared libraries.

These flags will be used by the linker when creating a shared library.

CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Flags to be used when linking a shared library.

Same as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_*`` but used by the linker when creating shared
libraries.

CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
---------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also ``CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``.

CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
``CMAKE_SHARED_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT``.

CMAKE_SKIP_BUILD_RPATH
----------------------

Do not include RPATHs in the build tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always built with no RPATH.

CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_RPATH
------------------------

Do not include RPATHs in the install tree.

Normally CMake uses the build tree for the RPATH when building
executables etc on systems that use RPATH.  When the software is
installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the
install RPATH.  If this variable is set to true then the software is
always installed without RPATH, even if RPATH is enabled when
building.  This can be useful for example to allow running tests from
the build directory with RPATH enabled before the installation step.
To omit RPATH in both the build and install steps, use
``CMAKE_SKIP_RPATH`` instead.

CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS
-------------------------

Flags to be used to create static libraries.  These flags will be passed
to the archiver when creating a static library.

See also ``CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``.

.. note::
  Static libraries do not actually link.  They are essentially archives
  of object files.  The use of the name "linker" in the name of this
  variable is kept for compatibility.

CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
----------------------------------

Flags to be used to create static libraries.  These flags will be passed
to the archiver when creating a static library in the ``<CONFIG>``
configuration.

See also ``CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS``.

.. note::
  Static libraries do not actually link.  They are essentially archives
  of object files.  The use of the name "linker" in the name of this
  variable is kept for compatibility.

CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
---------------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also ``CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT``.

CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_INIT
------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS``
cache entry the first time a build tree is configured.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific variable
``CMAKE_STATIC_LINKER_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT``.

CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_CONFIGURATION
-------------------------------

Build configuration used for ``try_compile()`` and ``try_run()``
projects.

Projects built by ``try_compile()`` and ``try_run()`` are built
synchronously during the CMake configuration step.  Therefore a specific build
configuration must be chosen even if the generated build system
supports multiple configurations.

CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES
------------------------------------

List of variables that the ``try_compile()`` command source file signature
must propagate into the test project in order to target the same platform as
the host project.

This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake's platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``.

Variables meaningful to CMake, such as ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS``, are
propagated automatically.  The ``CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES``
variable may be set to pass custom variables meaningful to a toolchain file.
For example, a toolchain file may contain:

 set(CMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME ...)
 set(CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_PLATFORM_VARIABLES MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE)
 # ... use MY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE ...

If a user passes ``-DMY_CUSTOM_VARIABLE=SomeValue`` to CMake then this
setting will be made visible to the toolchain file both for the main
project and for test projects generated by the ``try_compile()``
command source file signature.

CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE
-----------------------------

Type of target generated for ``try_compile()`` calls using the
source file signature.  Valid values are:

``EXECUTABLE``
  Use ``add_executable()`` to name the source file in the
  generated project.  This is the default if no value is given.

``STATIC_LIBRARY``
  Use ``add_library()`` with the ``STATIC`` option to name the
  source file in the generated project.  This avoids running the
  linker and is intended for use with cross-compiling toolchains
  that cannot link without custom flags or linker scripts.

CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD
-----------------

Initializes the ``UNITY_BUILD`` target property on targets
as they are created.  Set to ``ON`` to batch compilation of multiple
sources within each target.  This feature is known as "Unity build",
or "Jumbo build".  By default this variable is not set and so does
not enable unity builds on targets.

.. note::
  This option currently does not work well in combination with
  the ``CMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS`` variable.

CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE
----------------------------

Default value for ``UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE`` of targets.

By default ``CMAKE_UNITY_BUILD_BATCH_SIZE`` is set to ``8``.

property when a target is created.

CMAKE_VS_GLOBALS
----------------

List of ``Key=Value`` records to be set per target as target properties
``VS_GLOBAL_<variable>`` with ``variable=Key`` and value ``Value``.

For example:

 set(CMAKE_VS_GLOBALS
   "DefaultLanguage=en-US"
   "MinimumVisualStudioVersion=14.0"
   )

will set properties ``VS_GLOBAL_DefaultLanguage`` to ``en-US`` and
``VS_GLOBAL_MinimumVisualStudioVersion`` to ``14.0`` for all targets
(except for ``INTERFACE`` libraries).

This variable is meant to be set by a
``toolchain file``.

CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_INSTALL_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD
-----------------------------------------

Include ``INSTALL`` target to default build.

In Visual Studio solution, by default the ``INSTALL`` target will not be part
of the default build. Setting this variable will enable the ``INSTALL`` target
to be part of the default build.

CMAKE_VS_INCLUDE_PACKAGE_TO_DEFAULT_BUILD
-----------------------------------------

Include ``PACKAGE`` target to default build.

In Visual Studio solution, by default the ``PACKAGE`` target will not be part
of the default build. Setting this variable will enable the ``PACKAGE`` target
to be part of the default build.

CMAKE_VS_JUST_MY_CODE_DEBUGGING
-------------------------------

Enable Just My Code with Visual Studio debugger.

target platform compiles as WinRT by default (compiles with ``/ZW``).

This variable is meant to be set by a
``toolchain file`` for such platforms.

CMAKE_WIN32_EXECUTABLE
----------------------

Default value for ``WIN32_EXECUTABLE`` of targets.

This variable is used to initialize the ``WIN32_EXECUTABLE`` property
on all the targets.  See that target property for additional information.

Tell the ``Xcode`` generator to set '<an-attribute>' to a given value
in the generated Xcode project.  Ignored on other generators.

See the ``XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>`` target property
to set attributes on a specific target.

Contents of ``CMAKE_XCODE_ATTRIBUTE_<an-attribute>`` may use
"generator expressions" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the
``cmake-generator-expressions(7)`` manual for available
expressions.  See the ``cmake-buildsystem(7)`` manual
for more on defining buildsystem properties.

EXECUTABLE_OUTPUT_PATH

Old executable location variable.

The target property ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY`` supercedes this
variable for a target if it is set.  Executable targets are otherwise placed in
this directory.

LIBRARY_OUTPUT_PATH
-------------------

Old library location variable.

The target properties ``ARCHIVE_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``,
``LIBRARY_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``, and ``RUNTIME_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY``
supersede this variable for a target if they are set.  Library targets are
otherwise placed in this directory.

Some compiler toolchains do not ship their own auxiliary utilities such as
archivers and linkers.  The compiler driver may support a command-line argument
to specify the location of such tools.
``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN`` may be set to a path to
the external toolchain and will be passed to the compiler driver if supported.

This variable may only be set in a toolchain file specified by
the ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE`` variable.

  Initialized by the ``CFLAGS`` environment variable.
* ``CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS``:
  Initialized by the ``CXXFLAGS`` environment variable.
* ``CMAKE_CUDA_FLAGS``:
  Initialized by the ``CUDAFLAGS`` environment variable.
* ``CMAKE_Fortran_FLAGS``:

CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>
---------------------------

Flags for language ``<LANG>`` when building for the ``<CONFIG>`` configuration.

CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT
--------------------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>`` cache
entry the first time a build tree is configured for language ``<LANG>``.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_INIT``.

CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG

-----------------------

Value used to initialize the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS`` cache entry
the first time a build tree is configured for language ``<LANG>``.
This variable is meant to be set by a :variable:`toolchain file
<CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE>`.  CMake may prepend or append content to
the value based on the environment and target platform.

See also the configuration-specific
``CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_<CONFIG>_INIT`` variable.

CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_MINSIZEREL
-----------------------------

This variable is the ``MinSizeRel`` variant of the

------------------------------

File extensions that should be ignored by the build.

This is a list of file extensions that may be part of a project for a
given language but are not compiled.

CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------------------

Directories implicitly searched by the compiler for header files.

CMake does not explicitly specify these directories on compiler
command lines for language ``<LANG>``.  This prevents system include
directories from being treated as user include directories on some
compilers, which is important for ``C``, ``CXX``, and ``CUDA`` to
avoid overriding standard library headers.

This value is not used for ``Fortran`` because it has no standard
library headers and some compilers do not search their implicit
include directories for module ``.mod`` files.

CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_DIRECTORIES
--------------------------------------

Implicit linker search path detected for language ``<LANG>``.

Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime
libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker.
These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's
language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each
language and reports the results in this variable.

Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such as
``LIBRARY_PATH``.  If using such an environment variable, keep its value
consistent when operating in a given build tree because CMake saves the value
detected when first creating a build tree.

If policy ``CMP0060`` is not set to ``NEW``, then when a library in one
of these directories is given by full path to ``target_link_libraries()``
CMake will generate the ``-l<name>`` form on link lines for historical
purposes.

CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_FRAMEWORK_DIRECTORIES
------------------------------------------------

Implicit linker framework search path detected for language ``<LANG>``.

These paths are implicit linker framework search directories for the
compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these directories
for each language and reports the results in this variable.

CMAKE_<LANG>_IMPLICIT_LINK_LIBRARIES
------------------------------------

Implicit link libraries and flags detected for language ``<LANG>``.

Compilers typically pass language runtime library names and other
flags when they invoke a linker.  These flags are implicit link
options for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects
these libraries and flags for each language and reports the results in
this variable.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LIBRARY_ARCHITECTURE
---------------------------------

Target architecture library directory name detected for ``<LANG>``.

If the ``<LANG>`` compiler passes to the linker an architecture-specific
system library search directory such as ``<prefix>/lib/<arch>`` this
variable contains the ``<arch>`` name if/as detected by CMake.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE
------------------------------

Preference value for linker language selection.

The "linker language" for executable, shared library, and module
targets is the language whose compiler will invoke the linker.  The
``LINKER_LANGUAGE`` target property sets the language explicitly.
Otherwise, the linker language is that whose linker preference value
is highest among languages compiled and linked into the target.  See
also the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES`` variable.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE_PROPAGATES
-----------------------------------------

True if ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE`` propagates across targets.

This is used when CMake selects a linker language for a target.
Languages compiled directly into the target are always considered.  A
language compiled into static libraries linked by the target is
considered if this variable is true.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG
--------------------------------

Defines the syntax of compiler driver option to pass options to the linker
tool. It will be used to translate the ``LINKER:`` prefix in the link options
(see ``add_link_options()`` and ``target_link_options()``).

This variable holds a :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` of tokens.
If a space (i.e. " ") is specified as last token, flag and ``LINKER:``
arguments will be specified as separate arguments to the compiler driver.
The ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP`` variable can be specified
to manage concatenation of arguments.

For example, for ``Clang`` we have:

 set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG "-Xlinker" " ")

Specifying ``"LINKER:-z,defs"`` will be transformed in
``-Xlinker -z -Xlinker defs``.

For ``GNU GCC``:

 set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG "-Wl,")
 set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP ",")

Specifying ``"LINKER:-z,defs"`` will be transformed in ``-Wl,-z,defs``.

And for ``SunPro``:

 set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG "-Qoption" "ld" " ")
 set (CMAKE_C_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP ",")

Specifying ``"LINKER:-z,defs"`` will be transformed in ``-Qoption ld -z,defs``.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG_SEP
------------------------------------

This variable is used with ``CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_WRAPPER_FLAG``
variable to format ``LINKER:`` prefix in the link options
(see ``add_link_options()`` and ``target_link_options()``).

When specified, arguments of the ``LINKER:`` prefix will be concatenated using
this value as separator.

CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_EXECUTABLE
----------------------------

Rule variable to link an executable.

Rule variable to link an executable for the given language.

CMAKE_<LANG>_OUTPUT_EXTENSION
-----------------------------

Extension for the output of a compile for a single file.

This is the extension for an object file for the given ``<LANG>``.  For
example ``.obj`` for C on Windows.

CMAKE_<LANG>_SIMULATE_ID
------------------------

Identification string of "simulated" compiler.

Some compilers simulate other compilers to serve as drop-in
replacements.  When CMake detects such a compiler it sets this
variable to what would have been the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID`` for
the simulated compiler.

CMAKE_<LANG>_SIMULATE_VERSION
-----------------------------

Version string of "simulated" compiler.

Some compilers simulate other compilers to serve as drop-in
replacements.  When CMake detects such a compiler it sets this
variable to what would have been the ``CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION``
for the simulated compiler.

CMAKE_<LANG>_SIZEOF_DATA_PTR
----------------------------

Size of pointer-to-data types for language ``<LANG>``.

This holds the size (in bytes) of pointer-to-data types in the target
platform ABI.  It is defined for languages ``C`` and ``CXX`` (C++).

CMAKE_<LANG>_SOURCE_FILE_EXTENSIONS
-----------------------------------

Extensions of source files for the given language.

This is the list of extensions for a given language's source files.

CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES
-----------------------------------------

Include directories to be used for every source file compiled with
the ``<LANG>`` compiler.  This is meant for specification of system
include directories needed by the language for the current platform.
The directories always appear at the end of the include path passed
to the compiler.

This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake's platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``.

See also ``CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_LIBRARIES``.

CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_LIBRARIES
-------------------------------

Libraries linked into every executable and shared library linked
for language ``<LANG>``.  This is meant for specification of system
libraries needed by the language for the current platform.

This variable should not be set by project code.  It is meant to be set by
CMake's platform information modules for the current toolchain, or by a
toolchain file when used with ``CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE``.

See also ``CMAKE_<LANG>_STANDARD_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES``.

CMAKE_Swift_LANGUAGE_VERSION
----------------------------

Set to the Swift language version number.  If not set, the oldest legacy
version known to be available in the host Xcode version is assumed:

* Swift ``4.0`` for Xcode 10.2 and above.
* Swift ``3.0`` for Xcode 8.3 and above.
* Swift ``2.3`` for Xcode 8.2 and below.

CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE_<LANG>
-------------------------------------

Specify a CMake file that overrides platform information for ``<LANG>``.

This is a language-specific version of
``CMAKE_USER_MAKE_RULES_OVERRIDE`` loaded only when enabling language
``<LANG>``.

Variables for CTest
===================

CTEST_BINARY_DIRECTORY
----------------------

Specify the CTest ``BuildDirectory`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

CTEST_BUILD_COMMAND
-------------------

Specify the CTest ``MakeCommand`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

------------------------

Specify the CTest ``BZRUpdateOptions`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

CTEST_CHANGE_ID
---------------

Specify the CTest ``ChangeId`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

----------------------

Tell the ``ctest_start()`` command how to checkout or initialize
the source directory in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

CTEST_CONFIGURATION_TYPE
------------------------

Specify the CTest ``DefaultCTestConfigurationType`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

CTEST_CONFIGURE_COMMAND
-----------------------

Specify the CTest ``ConfigureCommand`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND
----------------------

Specify the CTest ``CoverageCommand`` setting
in a ``ctest(1)`` dashboard client script.

Cobertura
'''''''''

Using Cobertura as the coverage generation within your multi-module
Java project can generate a series of XML files.

The Cobertura Coverage parser expects to read the coverage data from a
single XML file which contains the coverage data for all modules.
Cobertura has a program with the ability to merge given ``cobertura.ser`` files
and then another program to generate a combined XML file from the previous
merged file.  For command line testing, this can be done by hand prior to
CTest looking for the coverage files. For script builds,
set the ``CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND`` variable to point to a file which will
perform these same steps, such as a ``.sh`` or ``.bat`` file.

 set(CTEST_COVERAGE_COMMAND .../run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh)

where the ``run-coverage-and-consolidate.sh`` script is perhaps created by
the ``configure_file()`` command and might contain the following code:

 #!/usr/bin/env bash
 CoberturaFiles="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "cobertura.ser")"
 SourceDirs="$(find "/path/to/source" -name "java" -type d)"
 cobertura-merge --datafile coberturamerge.ser $CoberturaFiles
 cobertura-report --datafile coberturamerge.ser --destination . \
                  --format xml $SourceDirs

The script uses ``find`` to capture the paths to all of the ``cobertura.ser``
files found below the project's source directory.  It keeps the list of files
and supplies it as an argument to the ``cobertura-merge`` program. The
``--datafile`` argument signifies where the result of the merge will be kept.

The combined ``coberturamerge.ser`` file is then used to generate the XML report
using the ``cobertura-report`` program.  The call to the cobertura-report
program requires some named arguments.

``--datafila``
  path to the merged ``.ser`` file

``--destination``
  path to put the output files(s)

``--format``
  file format to write output in: xml or html

The rest of the supplied arguments consist of the full paths to the
``/src/main/java`` directories of each module within the source tree. These
directories are needed and should not be forgotten.

Variables for CPack
===================

CPACK_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES
--------------------------------

List of files which have been installed using an ``ABSOLUTE DESTINATION`` path.

This variable is a Read-Only variable which is set internally by CPack
during installation and before packaging using
``CMAKE_ABSOLUTE_DESTINATION_FILES`` defined in ``cmake_install.cmake``
scripts.  The value can be used within CPack project configuration
file and/or ``CPack<GEN>.cmake`` file of ``<GEN>`` generator.

CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
------------------------------------------

Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory (component case).

Similar usage as ``CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY`` but for the
component case.  See ``CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY``
documentation for the detail.

CPACK_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
-------------------------------------------

Ask CPack to error out as soon as a file with absolute ``INSTALL DESTINATION``
is encountered.

The fatal error is emitted before the installation of the offending
file takes place.  Some CPack generators, like ``NSIS``, enforce this
internally.  This variable triggers the definition
of ``CMAKE_ERROR_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION`` when CPack
runs.

CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY
--------------------------------

Boolean toggle to include/exclude top level directory.

When preparing a package CPack installs the item under the so-called
top level directory.  The purpose of is to include (set to ``1`` or ``ON`` or
``TRUE``) the top level directory in the package or not (set to ``0`` or
``OFF`` or ``FALSE``).

Each CPack generator has a built-in default value for this variable.
E.g.  Archive generators (ZIP, TGZ, ...) includes the top level
whereas RPM or DEB don't.  The user may override the default value by
setting this variable.

There is a similar variable
``CPACK_COMPONENT_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY`` which may be used
to override the behavior for the component packaging
case which may have different default value for historical (now
backward compatibility) reason.

CPACK_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS
-------------------------------------------

Default permissions for implicitly created directories during packaging.

This variable serves the same purpose during packaging as the
``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS`` variable
serves during installation (e.g. ``make install``).

If `include(CPack)` is used then by default this variable is set to the content
of ``CMAKE_INSTALL_DEFAULT_DIRECTORY_PERMISSIONS``.

CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX
------------------------------

The prefix used in the built package.

Each CPack generator has a default value (like ``/usr``).  This default
value may be overwritten from the ``CMakeLists.txt`` or the ``cpack(1)``
command line by setting an alternative value.  Example:

::

 set(CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX "/opt")

This is not the same purpose as ``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` which is used
when installing from the build tree without building a package.

CPACK_SET_DESTDIR
-----------------

Boolean toggle to make CPack use ``DESTDIR`` mechanism when packaging.

``DESTDIR`` means DESTination DIRectory.  It is commonly used by makefile
users in order to install software at non-default location.  It is a
basic relocation mechanism that should not be used on Windows (see
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` documentation).  It is usually invoked like
this:

::

 make DESTDIR=/home/john install

which will install the concerned software using the installation
prefix, e.g. ``/usr/local`` prepended with the ``DESTDIR`` value which
finally gives ``/home/john/usr/local``.  When preparing a package, CPack
first installs the items to be packaged in a local (to the build tree)
directory by using the same ``DESTDIR`` mechanism.  Nevertheless, if
``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` is set then CPack will set ``DESTDIR`` before doing the
local install.  The most noticeable difference is that without
``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR``, CPack uses ``CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX``
as a prefix whereas with ``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` set, CPack will use
``CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`` as a prefix.

Manually setting ``CPACK_SET_DESTDIR`` may help (or simply be necessary)
if some install rules uses absolute ``DESTINATION`` (see CMake
``install()`` command).  However, starting with CPack/CMake 2.8.3 RPM
and DEB installers tries to handle ``DESTDIR`` automatically so that it is
seldom necessary for the user to set it.

CPACK_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION
------------------------------------------

Ask CPack to warn each time a file with absolute ``INSTALL DESTINATION`` is
encountered.

This variable triggers the definition of
``CMAKE_WARN_ON_ABSOLUTE_INSTALL_DESTINATION`` when CPack runs
``cmake_install.cmake`` scripts.

Variable Expansion Operators
============================

CACHE
-----

Operator to read cache variables.

Use the syntax ``$CACHE{VAR}`` to read cache entry ``VAR``.
See the :ref:`cmake-language(7) variables <CMake Language Variables>`
documentation for more complete documentation of the interaction of
normal variables and cache entries.

When evaluating :ref:`Variable References` of the form ``${VAR}``,
CMake first searches for a normal variable with that name, and if not
found CMake will search for a cache entry with that name.
The ``$CACHE{VAR}`` syntax can be used to do direct cache lookup and
ignore any existing normal variable.

See the ``set()`` and ``unset()`` commands to see how to
write or remove cache variables.

ENV
---

Operator to read environment variables.

Use the syntax ``$ENV{VAR}`` to read environment variable ``VAR``.

To test whether an environment variable is defined, use the signature
``if(DEFINED ENV{<name>})`` of the ``if()`` command.

See the ``set()`` and ``unset()`` commands to see how to
write or remove environment variables.

Internal Variables
==================

CMake has many internal variables.  Most of them are undocumented.
Some of them, however, were at some point described as normal
variables, and therefore may be encountered in legacy code. They
are subject to change, and not recommended for use in project code.

CMAKE_HOME_DIRECTORY
--------------------

Path to top of source tree. Same as ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``.

This is an internal cache entry used to locate the source directory
when loading a ``CMakeCache.txt`` from a build tree.  It should not
be used in project code.  The variable ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR``
has the same value and should be preferred.

CMAKE_INTERNAL_PLATFORM_ABI
---------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ABI
-------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used in determining the compiler ABI and is subject to change.

CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ARCHITECTURE_ID
-------------------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on its target
architecture.  For some compilers this is needed to determine the correct
usage.

CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_VERSION_INTERNAL
--------------------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used to identify the variant of a compiler based on an internal
version number.  For some compilers this is needed to determine the
correct usage.

CMAKE_<LANG>_PLATFORM_ID
------------------------

An internal variable subject to change.

This is used in determining the platform and is subject to change.

CMAKE_NOT_USING_CONFIG_FLAGS
----------------------------

Skip ``_BUILD_TYPE`` flags if true.

This is an internal flag used by the generators in CMake to tell CMake
to skip the ``_BUILD_TYPE`` flags.

CMAKE_VS_INTEL_Fortran_PROJECT_VERSION
--------------------------------------

When generating for ``Visual Studio 9 2008`` or greater with the Intel
Fortran plugin installed, this specifies the ``.vfproj`` project file format
version.  This is intended for internal use by CMake and should not be
used by project code.

different formats:

  - 7Z - 7zip - (.7z)
  - TBZ2 (.tar.bz2)
  - TGZ (.tar.gz)
  - TXZ (.tar.xz)
  - TZ (.tar.Z)
  - TZST (.tar.zst)
  - ZIP (.zip)

Variables specific to CPack Archive generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: CPACK_ARCHIVE_FILE_NAME
              CPACK_ARCHIVE_<component>_FILE_NAME

 Package file name without extension which is added automatically depending
 on the archive format.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``<CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>[-<component>].<extension>`` with
               spaces replaced by '-'

.. variable:: CPACK_ARCHIVE_COMPONENT_INSTALL

 Enable component packaging for CPackArchive

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

 If enabled (ON) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package
 containing files of all components is generated.

CPack Bundle Generator
----------------------

CPack Bundle generator (macOS) specific options

Variables specific to CPack Bundle generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Installers built on macOS using the Bundle generator use the
aforementioned DragNDrop (``CPACK_DMG_xxx``) variables, plus the following
Bundle-specific parameters (``CPACK_BUNDLE_xxx``).

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_NAME

 The name of the generated bundle. This appears in the macOS Finder as the
 bundle name. Required.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_PLIST

 Path to an macOS Property List (``.plist``) file that will be used
 for the generated bundle. This
 assumes that the caller has generated or specified their own ``Info.plist``
 file. Required.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_ICON

 Path to an macOS icon file that will be used as the icon for the generated
 bundle. This is the icon that appears in the macOS Finder for the bundle, and
 in the macOS dock when the bundle is opened. Required.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_STARTUP_COMMAND

 Path to a startup script. This is a path to an executable or script that
 will be run whenever an end-user double-clicks the generated bundle in the
 macOS Finder. Optional.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_CERT_APP

 The name of your Apple supplied code signing certificate for the application.
 The name usually takes the form ``Developer ID Application: [Name]`` or
 ``3rd Party Mac Developer Application: [Name]``. If this variable is not set
 the application will not be signed.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_ENTITLEMENTS

 The name of the Property List (``.plist``) file that contains your Apple
 entitlements for sandboxing your application. This file is required
 for submission to the macOS App Store.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_CODESIGN_FILES

 A list of additional files that you wish to be signed. You do not need to
 list the main application folder, or the main executable. You should
 list any frameworks and plugins that are included in your app bundle.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUNDLE_APPLE_CODESIGN_PARAMETER

 Additional parameter that will passed to ``codesign``.
 Default value: ``--deep -f``

.. variable:: CPACK_COMMAND_CODESIGN

 Path to the ``codesign(1)`` command used to sign applications with an
 Apple cert. This variable can be used to override the automatically
 detected command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails
 to find it).

CPack Cygwin Generator
----------------------

Cygwin CPack generator (Cygwin).

Variables specific to CPack Cygwin generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The
following variable is specific to installers build on and/or for
Cygwin:

.. variable:: CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_NUMBER

 The Cygwin patch number.  FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.

.. variable:: CPACK_CYGWIN_PATCH_FILE

 The Cygwin patch file.  FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.

.. variable:: CPACK_CYGWIN_BUILD_SCRIPT

 The Cygwin build script.  FIXME: This documentation is incomplete.

CPack DEB Generator
-------------------

The built in (binary) CPack DEB generator (Unix only)

Variables specific to CPack Debian (DEB) generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack DEB generator may be used to create DEB package using ``CPack``.
The CPack DEB generator is a ``CPack`` generator thus it uses the
``CPACK_XXX`` variables used by ``CPack``.

The CPack DEB generator should work on any Linux host but it will produce
better deb package when Debian specific tools ``dpkg-xxx`` are usable on
the build system.

The CPack DEB generator has specific features which are controlled by the
specifics ``CPACK_DEBIAN_XXX`` variables.

``CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_XXXX`` variables may be used in order to have
**component** specific values.  Note however that ``<COMPONENT>`` refers to
the **grouping name** written in upper case. It may be either a component name
or a component GROUP name.

Here are some CPack DEB generator wiki resources that are here for historic
reasons and are no longer maintained but may still prove useful:

 - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cpack/Configuration
 - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cpack/PackageGenerators#deb-unix-only

List of CPack DEB generator specific variables:

.. variable:: CPACK_DEB_COMPONENT_INSTALL

 Enable component packaging for CPackDEB

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

 If enabled (ON) multiple packages are generated. By default a single package
 containing files of all components is generated.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_NAME
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_NAME

 Set Package control field (variable is automatically transformed to lower
 case).

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   :

   - ``CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME`` for non-component based
     installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_NAME`` suffixed with -<COMPONENT>
     for component-based installations.

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_FILE_NAME
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_FILE_NAME

 Package file name.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``<CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>[-<component>].deb``

 This may be set to ``DEB-DEFAULT`` to allow the CPack DEB generator to generate
 package file name by itself in deb format::

   <PackageName>_<VersionNumber>-<DebianRevisionNumber>_<DebianArchitecture>.deb

 Alternatively provided package file name must end
 with either ``.deb`` or ``.ipk`` suffix.

 .. note::

   Preferred setting of this variable is ``DEB-DEFAULT`` but for backward
   compatibility with the CPack DEB generator in CMake prior to version 3.6 this
   feature is disabled by default.

 .. note::

   By using non default filenames duplicate names may occur. Duplicate files
   get overwritten and it is up to the packager to set the variables in a
   manner that will prevent such errors.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH

 The Debian package epoch

 * Mandatory : No
 * Default   : -

 Optional number that should be incremented when changing versioning schemas
 or fixing mistakes in the version numbers of older packages.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_VERSION

 The Debian package version

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``CPACK_PACKAGE_VERSION``

 This variable may contain only alphanumerics (A-Za-z0-9) and the characters
 . + - ~ (full stop, plus, hyphen, tilde) and should start with a digit. If
 ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE`` is not set then hyphens are not
 allowed.

 .. note::

 For backward compatibility with CMake 3.9 and lower a failed test of this
 variable's content is not a hard error when both
 :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE` and
 :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_EPOCH` variables are not set. An author
 warning is reported instead.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RELEASE

 The Debian package release - Debian revision number.

 * Mandatory : No
 * Default   : -

 This is the numbering of the DEB package itself, i.e. the version of the
 packaging and not the version of the content (see
 ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_VERSION``). One may change the default value
 if the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here a fancy Linux
 distro specific numbering.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE

 The Debian package architecture

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : Output of ``dpkg --print-architecture`` (or ``i386``
   if ``dpkg`` is not found)

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS

 Sets the Debian dependencies of this package.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS`` for component-based
     installations.

 .. note::

   If :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS` or
   more specifically :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS`
   is set for this component, the discovered dependencies will be appended
   to :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS` instead of
   :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS`. If
   :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_DEPENDS` is an empty string,
   only the automatically discovered dependencies will be set for this
   component.

 Example::

   set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEPENDS "libc6 (>= 2.3.1-6), libc6 (< 2.4)")

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_ENABLE_COMPONENT_DEPENDS

 Sets inter component dependencies if listed with
 ``CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DEPENDS`` variables.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER

 The Debian package maintainer

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``CPACK_PACKAGE_CONTACT``

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_DESCRIPTION

 The Debian package description

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   :

   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_DESCRIPTION`` (component
     based installers only) if set, or ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`` if set, or
   - ``CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION`` (component
     based installers only) if set, or ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`` if set, or
   - content of the file specified in ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE`` if set

 If after that description is not set, ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY`` going to be
 used if set. Otherwise, ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY`` will be added as the first
 line of description as defined in Debian Policy Manual.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SECTION
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SECTION

 Set Section control field e.g. admin, devel, doc, ...

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : "devel"

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-archive.html#s-subsections

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_ARCHIVE_TYPE

 The archive format used for creating the Debian package.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : "gnutar"

 Possible value is:

 - gnutar

 .. note::

 This variable previously defaulted to the ``paxr`` value, but ``dpkg``
 has never supported that tar format. For backwards compatibility the
 ``paxr`` value will be mapped to ``gnutar`` and a deprecation message
 will be emitted.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_COMPRESSION_TYPE

 The compression used for creating the Debian package.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : "gzip"

 Possible values are:

 - lzma
 - xz

 The URL of the web site for this package, preferably (when applicable) the
 site from which the original source can be obtained and any additional
 upstream documentation or information may be found.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL``

 .. note::

 The content of this field is a simple URL without any surrounding
 characters such as <>.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS

 May be set to ON in order to use ``dpkg-shlibdeps`` to generate
 better package dependency list.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SHLIBDEPS`` if set or
   - OFF

 .. note::

 You may need set :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` to an appropriate value
 if you use this feature, because if you don't ``dpkg-shlibdeps``
 may fail to find your own shared libs.
 See https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cmake/RPATH-handling

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DEBUG

 May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug information
 during the CPack DEB generator run.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS

 Sets the `Pre-Depends` field of the Debian package.
 Like ``Depends``, except that it
 also forces ``dpkg`` to complete installation of the packages named
 before even starting the installation of the package which declares the
 pre-dependency.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PREDEPENDS`` for component-based
     installations.

 See http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ENHANCES
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_ENHANCES

 Sets the `Enhances` field of the Debian package.
 Similar to ``Suggests`` but works
 in the opposite direction: declares that a package can enhance the
 functionality of another package.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_ENHANCES`` for component-based
     installations.

 See http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_BREAKS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_BREAKS

 Sets the `Breaks` field of the Debian package.
 When a binary package (P) declares that it breaks other packages (B),
 ``dpkg`` will not allow the package (P) which declares `Breaks` be
 **unpacked** unless the packages that will be broken (B) are deconfigured
 first.
 As long as the package (P) is configured, the previously deconfigured
 packages (B) cannot be reconfigured again.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_BREAKS`` for component-based
     installations.

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-breaks

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS

 Sets the `Conflicts` field of the Debian package.
 When one binary package declares a conflict with another using a `Conflicts`
 field, ``dpkg`` will not allow them to be unpacked on the system at
 the same time.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONFLICTS`` for component-based
     installations.

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-conflicts

 .. note::

 This is a stronger restriction than
 :variable:`Breaks <CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_BREAKS>`, which prevents the
 broken package from being configured while the breaking package is in
 the "Unpacked" state but allows both packages to be unpacked at the same
 time.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PROVIDES
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PROVIDES

 Sets the `Provides` field of the Debian package.
 A virtual package is one which appears in the `Provides` control field of
 another package.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_PROVIDES`` for component-based
     installations.

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-virtual

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_REPLACES
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_REPLACES

 Sets the `Replaces` field of the Debian package.
 Packages can declare in their control file that they should overwrite
 files in certain other packages, or completely replace other packages.

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_REPLACES`` for component-based
     installations.

 See http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS

 Sets the `Recommends` field of the Debian package.
 Allows packages to declare a strong, but not absolute, dependency on other
 packages.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_RECOMMENDS`` for component-based
     installations.

 See http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS

 Sets the `Suggests` field of the Debian package.
 Allows packages to declare a suggested package install grouping.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SUGGESTS`` for component-based
     installations.

 See http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-relationships.html#s-binarydeps

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_GENERATE_SHLIBS

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

 Allows to generate shlibs control file automatically. Compatibility is defined by
 ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_GENERATE_SHLIBS_POLICY`` variable value.

 .. note::

 Libraries are only considered if they have both library name and version
 set. This can be done by setting SOVERSION property with
 :command:`set_target_properties` command.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_GENERATE_SHLIBS_POLICY

 Compatibility policy for auto-generated shlibs control file.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : "="

 Defines compatibility policy for auto-generated shlibs control file.
 Possible values: "=", ">="

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-sharedlibs.html#s-sharedlibs-shlibdeps

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA

 This variable allow advanced user to add custom script to the
 control.tar.gz.
 Typical usage is for conffiles, postinst, postrm, prerm.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 Usage::

  set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_EXTRA
      "${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/prerm;${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/postrm")

 .. note::

   The original permissions of the files will be used in the final
   package unless the variable
   :variable:`CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_STRICT_PERMISSION` is set.
   In particular, the scripts should have the proper executable
   flag prior to the generation of the package.

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_STRICT_PERMISSION
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_CONTROL_STRICT_PERMISSION

 This variable indicates if the Debian policy on control files should be
 strictly followed.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : FALSE

 Usage::

  set(CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_CONTROL_STRICT_PERMISSION TRUE)

 .. note::

   This overrides the permissions on the original files, following the rules
   set by Debian policy
   https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-files.html#s-permissions-owners

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SOURCE
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_SOURCE

 Sets the ``Source`` field of the binary Debian package.
 When the binary package name is not the same as the source package name
 (in particular when several components/binaries are generated from one
 source) the source from which the binary has been generated should be
 indicated with the field ``Source``.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   :

   - An empty string for non-component based installations
   - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_SOURCE`` for component-based
     installations.

 See https://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-controlfields.html#s-f-Source

 .. note::

 This value is not interpreted. It is possible to pass an optional
 revision number of the referenced source package as well.

Packaging of debug information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Dbgsym packages contain debug symbols for debugging packaged binaries.

Dbgsym packaging has its own set of variables:

.. variable:: CPACK_DEBIAN_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE
              CPACK_DEBIAN_<component>_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE

 Enable generation of dbgsym .ddeb package(s).

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

.. note::

 Binaries must contain debug symbols before packaging so use either ``Debug``
 or ``RelWithDebInfo`` for ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` variable value.

Building Debian packages on Windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To communicate UNIX file permissions from the install stage
to the CPack DEB generator the "cmake_mode_t" NTFS
alternate data stream (ADT) is used.

When a filesystem without ADT support is used only owner read/write
permissions can be preserved.

Reproducible packages
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The environment variable ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH`` may be set to a UNIX
timestamp, defined as the number of seconds, excluding leap seconds,
since 01 Jan 1970 00:00:00 UTC.  If set, the CPack DEB generator will
use its value for timestamps in the package.

CPack DragNDrop Generator
-------------------------

The DragNDrop CPack generator (macOS) creates a DMG image.

Variables specific to CPack DragNDrop generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables are specific to the DragNDrop installers built
on macOS:

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_VOLUME_NAME

 The volume name of the generated disk image. Defaults to
 CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_FORMAT

 The disk image format. Common values are ``UDRO`` (UDIF read-only), ``UDZO`` (UDIF
 zlib-compressed) or ``UDBZ`` (UDIF bzip2-compressed). Refer to ``hdiutil(1)`` for
 more information on other available formats. Defaults to ``UDZO``.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE

 Path to a custom ``.DS_Store`` file. This ``.DS_Store`` file can be used to
 specify the Finder window position/geometry and layout (such as hidden
 toolbars, placement of the icons etc.). This file has to be generated by
 the Finder (either manually or through AppleScript) using a normal folder
 from which the ``.DS_Store`` file can then be extracted.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE_SETUP_SCRIPT

 Path to a custom AppleScript file.  This AppleScript is used to generate
 a ``.DS_Store`` file which specifies the Finder window position/geometry and
 layout (such as hidden toolbars, placement of the icons etc.).
 By specifying a custom AppleScript there is no need to use
 ``CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE``, as the ``.DS_Store`` that is generated by the AppleScript
 will be packaged.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_BACKGROUND_IMAGE

 Path to an image file to be used as the background.  This file will be
 copied to ``.background``/``background.<ext>``, where ``<ext>`` is the original image file
 extension.  The background image is installed into the image before
 ``CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE_SETUP_SCRIPT`` is executed or ``CPACK_DMG_DS_STORE`` is
 installed.  By default no background image is set.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_DISABLE_APPLICATIONS_SYMLINK

 Default behaviour is to include a symlink to ``/Applications`` in the DMG.
 Set this option to ``ON`` to avoid adding the symlink.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_SLA_DIR

  Directory where license and menu files for different languages are stored.
  Setting this causes CPack to look for a ``<language>.menu.txt`` and
  ``<language>.license.txt`` file for every language defined in
  ``CPACK_DMG_SLA_LANGUAGES``. If both this variable and
  ``CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE`` are set, CPack will only look for the menu
  files and use the same license file for all languages.

.. variable:: CPACK_DMG_SLA_LANGUAGES

  Languages for which a license agreement is provided when mounting the
  generated DMG. A menu file consists of 9 lines of text. The first line is
  is the name of the language itself, uppercase, in English (e.g. German).
  The other lines are translations of the following strings:

  - Agree
  - Disagree
  - Print
  - Save...
  - You agree to the terms of the License Agreement when you click the
    "Agree" button.
  - Software License Agreement
  - This text cannot be saved. The disk may be full or locked, or the file
    may be locked.
  - Unable to print. Make sure you have selected a printer.

  For every language in this list, CPack will try to find files
  ``<language>.menu.txt`` and ``<language>.license.txt`` in the directory
  specified by the ``CPACK_DMG_SLA_DIR`` variable.

.. variable:: CPACK_COMMAND_HDIUTIL

 Path to the ``hdiutil(1)`` command used to operate on disk image files on
 macOS. This variable can be used to override the automatically detected
 command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails to find it).

.. variable:: CPACK_COMMAND_SETFILE

 Path to the ``SetFile(1)`` command used to set extended attributes on files and
 directories on macOS. This variable can be used to override the
 automatically detected command (or specify its location if the
 auto-detection fails to find it).

.. variable:: CPACK_COMMAND_REZ

 Path to the ``Rez(1)`` command used to compile resources on macOS. This
 variable can be used to override the automatically detected command (or
 specify its location if the auto-detection fails to find it).

CPack External Generator
------------------------

CPack provides many generators to create packages for a variety of platforms
and packaging systems. The intention is for CMake/CPack to be a complete
end-to-end solution for building and packaging a software project. However, it
may not always be possible to use CPack for the entire packaging process, due
to either technical limitations or policies that require the use of certain
tools. For this reason, CPack provides the "External" generator, which allows
external packaging software to take advantage of some of the functionality
provided by CPack, such as component installation and the dependency graph.

Integration with External Packaging Tools
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack External generator generates a ``.json`` file containing the
CPack internal metadata, which gives external software information
on how to package the software. External packaging software may itself
invoke CPack, consume the generated metadata,
install and package files as required.

Alternatively CPack can invoke an external packaging software
through an optional custom CMake script in
``CPACK_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE_SCRIPT`` instead.

Staging of installation files may also optionally be
taken care of by the generator when enabled through the
``CPACK_EXTERNAL_ENABLE_STAGING`` variable.

JSON Format
^^^^^^^^^^^

The JSON metadata file contains a list of CPack components and component groups,
the various options passed to ``cpack_add_component()`` and
``cpack_add_component_group()``, the dependencies between the components
and component groups, and various other options passed to CPack.

The JSON's root object will always provide two fields:
``formatVersionMajor`` and ``formatVersionMinor``, which are always integers
that describe the output format of the generator. Backwards-compatible changes
to the output format (for example, adding a new field that didn't exist before)
cause the minor version to be incremented, and backwards-incompatible changes
(for example, deleting a field or changing its meaning) cause the major version
to be incremented and the minor version reset to 0. The format version is
always of the format ``major.minor``. In other words, it always has exactly two
parts, separated by a period.

You can request one or more specific versions of the output format as described
below with ``CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS``. The output format will
have a major version that exactly matches the requested major version, and a
minor version that is greater than or equal to the requested minor version. If
no version is requested with ``CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS``, the
latest known major version is used by default. Currently, the only supported
format is 1.0, which is described below.

Version 1.0
***********

In addition to the standard format fields, format version 1.0 provides the
following fields in the root:

``components``
  The ``components`` field is an object with component names as the keys and
  objects describing the components as the values. The component objects have
  the following fields:

  ``name``
    The name of the component. This is always the same as the key in the
    ``components`` object.

  ``displayName``
    The value of the ``DISPLAY_NAME`` field passed to

    so, this field is a string value containing the component's group.

  ``dependencies``
    An array of components the component depends on. This contains the values
    in the ``DEPENDS`` argument passed to ``cpack_add_component()``. If no
    ``DEPENDS`` argument was passed, this is an empty list.

  ``installationTypes``
    An array of installation types the component is part of. This contains the
    values in the ``INSTALL_TYPES`` argument passed to
    ``cpack_add_component()``. If no ``INSTALL_TYPES`` argument was
    passed, this is an empty list.

    ``cpack_add_component()``. If no ``ARCHIVE_FILE`` argument was passed,
    this is an empty string.

``componentGroups``
  The ``componentGroups`` field is an object with component group names as the
  keys and objects describing the component groups as the values. The component
  group objects have the following fields:

  ``name``
    The name of the component group. This is always the same as the key in the
    ``componentGroups`` object.

    containing the component group's parent group.

  ``isExpandedByDefault``
    True if ``EXPANDED`` was passed to ``cpack_add_component_group()``,
    false if it was not.

  ``isBold``
    True if ``BOLD_TITLE`` was passed to ``cpack_add_component_group()``,
    false if it was not.

  ``index``
    The integer index of the installation type in the list.

``projects``
  The ``projects`` field is an array of objects describing CMake projects which
  comprise the CPack project. The values in this field are derived from
  ``CPACK_INSTALL_CMAKE_PROJECTS``. In most cases, this will be only a
  single project. The project objects have the following fields:

  false if it is not.

Variables specific to CPack External generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. variable:: CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS

  This variable is used to request a specific version of the CPack External
  generator. It is a list of ``major.minor`` values, separated by semicolons.

  If this variable is set to a non-empty value, the CPack External generator
  will iterate through each item in the list to search for a version that it
  knows how to generate. Requested versions should be listed in order of
  descending preference by the client software, as the first matching version
  in the list will be generated.

  The generator knows how to generate the version if it has a versioned
  generator whose major version exactly matches the requested major version,
  and whose minor version is greater than or equal to the requested minor
  version. For example, if ``CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS`` contains 1.0, and
  the CPack External generator knows how to generate 1.1, it will generate 1.1.
  If the generator doesn't know how to generate a version in the list, it skips
  the version and looks at the next one. If it doesn't know how to generate any
  of the requested versions, an error is thrown.

  If this variable is not set, or is empty, the CPack External generator will
  generate the highest major and minor version that it knows how to generate.

  If an invalid version is encountered in ``CPACK_EXTERNAL_REQUESTED_VERSIONS`` (one
  that doesn't match ``major.minor``, where ``major`` and ``minor`` are
  integers), it is ignored.

.. variable:: CPACK_EXTERNAL_ENABLE_STAGING

  This variable can be set to true to enable optional installation
  into a temporary staging area which can then be picked up
  and packaged by an external packaging tool.
  The top level directory used by CPack for the current packaging
  task is contained in ``CPACK_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY``.
  It is automatically cleaned up on each run before packaging is initiated
  and can be used for custom temporary files required by
  the external packaging tool.
  It also contains the staging area ``CPACK_TEMPORARY_DIRECTORY``
  into which CPack performs the installation when staging is enabled.

.. variable:: CPACK_EXTERNAL_PACKAGE_SCRIPT

  This variable can optionally specify the full path to
  a CMake script file to be run as part of the CPack invocation.
  It is invoked after (optional) staging took place and may
  run an external packaging tool. The script has access to
  the variables defined by the CPack config file.

CPack FreeBSD Generator
-----------------------

The built in (binary) CPack FreeBSD (pkg) generator (Unix only)

Variables specific to CPack FreeBSD (pkg) generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack FreeBSD generator may be used to create pkg(8) packages -- these may
be used on FreeBSD, DragonflyBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, but also on Linux or OSX,
depending on the installed package-management tools -- using ``CPack``.

The CPack FreeBSD generator is a ``CPack`` generator and uses the
``CPACK_XXX`` variables used by ``CPack``. It tries to re-use packaging
information that may already be specified for Debian packages for the
``CPack DEB Generator``. It also tries to re-use RPM packaging
information when Debian does not specify.

The CPack FreeBSD generator should work on any host with libpkg installed. The
packages it produces are specific to the host architecture and ABI.

The CPack FreeBSD generator sets package-metadata through
``CPACK_FREEBSD_XXX`` variables. The CPack FreeBSD generator, unlike the
CPack Deb generator, does not specially support componentized packages; a
single package is created from all the software artifacts created through
CMake.

All of the variables can be set specifically for FreeBSD packaging in
the CPackConfig file or in CMakeLists.txt, but most of them have defaults
that use general settings (e.g. CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME) or Debian-specific
variables when those make sense (e.g. the homepage of an upstream project
is usually unchanged by the flavor of packaging). When there is no Debian
information to fall back on, but the RPM packaging has it, fall back to
the RPM information (e.g. package license).

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_NAME

  Sets the package name (in the package manifest, but also affects the
  output filename).

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default:

    - ``CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME`` (this is always set by CPack itself,
      based on CMAKE_PROJECT_NAME).

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_COMMENT

  Sets the package comment. This is the short description displayed by
  pkg(8) in standard "pkg info" output.

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default:

    - ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY`` (this is always set
      by CPack itself, if nothing else sets it explicitly).
    - ``PROJECT_DESCRIPTION`` (this can be set with the DESCRIPTION
      parameter for ``project()``).

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION

  Sets the package description. This is the long description of the package,
  given by "pkg info" with a specific package as argument.

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default:

    - ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION`` (this may be set already
      for Debian packaging, so we may as well re-use it).

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_WWW

  The URL of the web site for this package, preferably (when applicable) the
  site from which the original source can be obtained and any additional
  upstream documentation or information may be found.

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default:

   - ``CMAKE_PROJECT_HOMEPAGE_URL``, or if that is not set,
     ``CPACK_DEBIAN_PACKAGE_HOMEPAGE`` (this may be set already
     for Debian packaging, so we may as well re-use it).

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_LICENSE

  The license, or licenses, which apply to this software package. This must
  be one or more license-identifiers that pkg recognizes as acceptable license
  identifiers (e.g. "GPLv2").

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default:

    - ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE``

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_LICENSE_LOGIC

  This variable is only of importance if there is more than one license.
  The default is "single", which is only applicable to a single license.
  Other acceptable values are determined by pkg -- those are "dual" or "multi" --
  meaning choice (OR) or simultaneous (AND) application of the licenses.

  * Mandatory: NO
  * Default: single

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_MAINTAINER

  The FreeBSD maintainer (e.g. kde@freebsd.org) of this package.

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default: none

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_ORIGIN

  The origin (ports label) of this package; for packages built by CPack
  outside of the ports system this is of less importance. The default
  puts the package somewhere under misc/, as a stopgap.

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default: misc/<package name>

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_CATEGORIES

  The ports categories where this package lives (if it were to be built
  from ports). If none is set a single category is determined based on
  the package origin.

  * Mandatory: YES
  * Default: derived from ORIGIN

.. variable:: CPACK_FREEBSD_PACKAGE_DEPS

  A list of package origins that should be added as package dependencies.
  These are in the form <category>/<packagename>, e.g. x11/libkonq.
  No version information needs to be provided (this is not included
  in the manifest).

  * Mandatory: NO
  * Default: empty

CPack IFW Generator
-------------------

See ``CPackIFW`` for details on the CPackIFW module.

Overview
^^^^^^^^

CPack ``IFW`` generator helps you to create online and offline
binary cross-platform installers with a graphical user interface.

CPack IFW generator prepares project installation and generates configuration
and meta information for QtIFW_ tools.

The QtIFW_ provides a set of tools and utilities to create
installers for the supported desktop Qt platforms: Linux, Microsoft Windows,
and macOS.

You should also install QtIFW_ to use CPack ``IFW`` generator.

Hints
^^^^^

Generally, the CPack ``IFW`` generator automatically finds QtIFW_ tools,
but if you don't use a default path for installation of the QtIFW_ tools,
the path may be specified in either a CMake or an environment variable:

.. variable:: CPACK_IFW_ROOT

 An CMake variable which specifies the location of the QtIFW_ tool suite.

 The variable will be cached in the ``CPackConfig.cmake`` file and used at
 CPack runtime.

.. variable:: QTIFWDIR

 An environment variable which specifies the location of the QtIFW_ tool
 suite.

.. note::
  The specified path should not contain "bin" at the end
  (for example: "D:\\DevTools\\QtIFW2.0.5").

The ``CPACK_IFW_ROOT`` variable has a higher priority and overrides
the value of the ``QTIFWDIR`` variable.

Internationalization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Some variables and command arguments support internationalization via
CMake script. This is an optional feature.

Installers created by QtIFW_ tools have built-in support for
internationalization and many phrases are localized to many languages,
but this does not apply to the description of the your components and groups
that will be distributed.

Localization of the description of your components and groups is useful for
users of your installers.

A localized variable or argument can contain a single default value, and a
set of pairs the name of the locale and the localized value.

For example:

 set(LOCALIZABLE_VARIABLE "Default value"
   en "English value"
   en_US "American value"
   en_GB "Great Britain value"
   )

Online installer
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

By default CPack IFW generator makes offline installer. This means that all
components will be packaged into a binary file.

To make a component downloaded, you must set the ``DOWNLOADED`` option in
``cpack_add_component()``.

Then you would use the command ``cpack_configure_downloads()``.
If you set ``ALL`` option all components will be downloaded.

You also can use command ``cpack_ifw_add_repository()`` and
variable ``CPACK_IFW_DOWNLOAD_ALL`` for more specific configuration.

CPack IFW generator creates "repository" dir in current binary dir. You
would copy content of this dir to specified ``site`` (``url``).

     "CMake Help" "https://cmake.org" "CMake Web Site")

CPack NuGet Generator
---------------------

When build a NuGet package there is no direct way to control an output
filename due a lack of the corresponding CLI option of NuGet, so there
is no ``CPACK_NUGET_PACKAGE_FILENAME`` variable. To form the output filename
NuGet uses the package name and the version according to its built-in rules.

Also, be aware that including a top level directory
(``CPACK_INCLUDE_TOPLEVEL_DIRECTORY``) is ignored by this generator.


Variables specific to CPack NuGet generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack NuGet generator may be used to create NuGet packages using
``CPack``. The CPack NuGet generator is a ``CPack`` generator thus
it uses the ``CPACK_XXX`` variables used by ``CPack``.

The CPack NuGet generator has specific features which are controlled by the
specifics ``CPACK_NUGET_XXX`` variables. In the "one per group" mode
(see ``CPACK_COMPONENTS_GROUPING``), ``<compName>`` placeholder

CPack PackageMaker Generator
----------------------------

PackageMaker CPack generator (macOS).

Variables specific to CPack PackageMaker generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variable is specific to installers built on Mac
macOS using PackageMaker:

.. variable:: CPACK_OSX_PACKAGE_VERSION

 The version of macOS that the resulting PackageMaker archive should be
 compatible with. Different versions of macOS support different
 features. For example, CPack can only build component-based installers for
 macOS 10.4 or newer, and can only build installers that download
 component son-the-fly for macOS 10.5 or newer. If left blank, this value
 will be set to the minimum version of macOS that supports the requested
 features. Set this variable to some value (e.g., 10.4) only if you want to
 guarantee that your installer will work on that version of macOS, and
 don't mind missing extra features available in the installer shipping with
 later versions of macOS.

CPack productbuild Generator
----------------------------

productbuild CPack generator (macOS).

Variables specific to CPack productbuild generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variable is specific to installers built on Mac
macOS using ProductBuild:

.. variable:: CPACK_COMMAND_PRODUCTBUILD

 Path to the ``productbuild(1)`` command used to generate a product archive for
 the macOS Installer or Mac App Store.  This variable can be used to override
 the automatically detected command (or specify its location if the
 auto-detection fails to find it).

.. variable:: CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_IDENTITY_NAME

 Adds a digital signature to the resulting package.


.. variable:: CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_KEYCHAIN_PATH

 Specify a specific keychain to search for the signing identity.


.. variable:: CPACK_COMMAND_PKGBUILD

 Path to the ``pkgbuild(1)`` command used to generate an macOS component package
 on macOS.  This variable can be used to override the automatically detected
 command (or specify its location if the auto-detection fails to find it).


.. variable:: CPACK_PKGBUILD_IDENTITY_NAME

 Adds a digital signature to the resulting package.


.. variable:: CPACK_PKGBUILD_KEYCHAIN_PATH

 Specify a specific keychain to search for the signing identity.


.. variable:: CPACK_PREFLIGHT_<COMP>_SCRIPT

 Full path to a file that will be used as the ``preinstall`` script for the
 named ``<COMP>`` component's package, where ``<COMP>`` is the uppercased
 component name.  No ``preinstall`` script is added if this variable is not
 defined for a given component.


.. variable:: CPACK_POSTFLIGHT_<COMP>_SCRIPT

 Full path to a file that will be used as the ``postinstall`` script for the
 named ``<COMP>`` component's package, where ``<COMP>`` is the uppercased
 component name.  No ``postinstall`` script is added if this variable is not
 defined for a given component.


.. variable:: CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_RESOURCES_DIR

 If specified the productbuild generator copies files from this directory
 (including subdirectories) to the ``Resources`` directory. This is done
 before the ``CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_WELCOME``,
 ``CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_README``, and
 ``CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE`` files are copied.

CPack RPM Generator
-------------------

The built in (binary) CPack RPM generator (Unix only)

Variables specific to CPack RPM generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack RPM generator may be used to create RPM packages using ``CPack``.
The CPack RPM generator is a ``CPack`` generator thus it uses the
``CPACK_XXX`` variables used by ``CPack``.

The CPack RPM generator has specific features which are controlled by the specifics
``CPACK_RPM_XXX`` variables.

``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_XXXX`` variables may be used in order to have
**component** specific values.  Note however that ``<COMPONENT>`` refers to the
**grouping name** written in upper case. It may be either a component name or
a component GROUP name. Usually those variables correspond to RPM spec file
entities. One may find information about spec files here
http://www.rpm.org/wiki/Docs

.. note::

 `<COMPONENT>` part of variables is preferred to be in upper case (e.g. if
 component is named ``foo`` then use ``CPACK_RPM_FOO_XXXX`` variable name format)
 as is with other ``CPACK_<COMPONENT>_XXXX`` variables.
 For the purposes of back compatibility (CMake/CPack version 3.5 and lower)
 support for same cased component (e.g. ``fOo`` would be used as
 ``CPACK_RPM_fOo_XXXX``) is still supported for variables defined in older
 versions of CMake/CPack but is not guaranteed for variables that
 will be added in the future. For the sake of back compatibility same cased
 component variables also override upper cased versions where both are
 present.

Here are some CPack RPM generator wiki resources that are here for historic
reasons and are no longer maintained but may still prove useful:

 - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cpack/Configuration
 - https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/community/wikis/doc/cpack/PackageGenerators#rpm-unix-only

List of CPack RPM generator specific variables:

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL

 Enable component packaging for CPack RPM generator

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

 If enabled (``ON``) multiple packages are generated. By default
 a single package containing files of all components is generated.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SUMMARY
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_SUMMARY

 The RPM package summary.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_SUMMARY``

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_NAME
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_NAME

 The RPM package name.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME``

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_FILE_NAME
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_FILE_NAME

 Package file name.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : ``<CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>[-<component>].rpm`` with spaces
               replaced by '-'

 This may be set to ``RPM-DEFAULT`` to allow ``rpmbuild`` tool to generate package
 file name by itself.
 Alternatively provided package file name must end with ``.rpm`` suffix.

 .. note::

 By using user provided spec file, rpm macro extensions such as for
 generating ``debuginfo`` packages or by simply using multiple components more
 than one rpm file may be generated, either from a single spec file or from
 multiple spec files (each component execution produces its own spec file).
 In such cases duplicate file names may occur as a result of this variable
 setting or spec file content structure. Duplicate files get overwritten
 and it is up to the packager to set the variables in a manner that will
 prevent such errors.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_MAIN_COMPONENT

 Main component that is packaged without component suffix.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 This variable can be set to any component or group name so that component or
 group rpm package is generated without component suffix in filename and
 package name.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_EPOCH

 The RPM package epoch

 * Mandatory : No
 * Default   : -

              CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_ARCHITECTURE

 The RPM package architecture.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : Native architecture output by ``uname -m``

 This may be set to ``noarch`` if you know you are building a ``noarch`` package.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE

 The RPM package release.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : 1

 This is the numbering of the RPM package itself, i.e. the version of the
 packaging and not the version of the content (see
 ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_VERSION``). One may change the default value if
 the previous packaging was buggy and/or you want to put here a fancy Linux
 distro specific numbering.

.. note::

 This is the string that goes into the RPM ``Release:`` field. Some distros
 (e.g. Fedora, CentOS) require ``1%{?dist}`` format and not just a number.
 ``%{?dist}`` part can be added by setting ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIST``.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE_DIST

 The dist tag that is added  RPM ``Release:`` field.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

 This is the reported ``%{dist}`` tag from the current distribution or empty
 ``%{dist}`` if RPM macro is not set. If this variable is set then RPM
 ``Release:`` field value is set to ``${CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELEASE}%{?dist}``.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_LICENSE

 The RPM package license policy.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : "unknown"

              CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION

 RPM package description.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default : ``CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION`` (component
   based installers only) if set, ``CPACK_PACKAGE_DESCRIPTION_FILE``
   if set or "no package description available"

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_COMPRESSION_TYPE

 RPM compression type.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to override RPM compression type to be used to build the
 RPM. For example some Linux distribution now default to ``lzma`` or ``xz``
 compression whereas older cannot use such RPM. Using this one can enforce
 compression type to be used.

 Possible values are:

 - lzma
 - xz
 - bzip2
 - gzip

 .. note::

 By default automatic provides detection is enabled by rpm generator.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_AUTOREQPROV
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_PACKAGE_AUTOREQPROV

 RPM spec autoreqprov field.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 Variable enables/disables autoreq and autoprov at the same time.
 See ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_AUTOREQ`` and
 ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_AUTOPROV`` for more details.

 .. note::

 By default automatic detection feature is enabled by rpm.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE

 build a relocatable RPM.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : CPACK_PACKAGE_RELOCATABLE

 If this variable is set to TRUE or ON, the CPack RPM generator will try
 to build a relocatable RPM package. A relocatable RPM may
 be installed using::

  rpm --prefix or --relocate

 in order to install it at an alternate place see rpm(8). Note that
 currently this may fail if :variable:`CPACK_SET_DESTDIR` is set to ``ON``. If
 :variable:`CPACK_SET_DESTDIR` is set then you will get a warning message but
 if there is file installed with absolute path you'll get unexpected behavior.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_SPEC_INSTALL_POST

 Deprecated - use ``CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE`` instead.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -
 * Deprecated: YES

 May be used to override the ``__spec_install_post`` section within the
 generated spec file.  This affects the install step during package creation,
 not during package installation.  For adding operations to be performed
 during package installation, use
 ``CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE`` instead.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE

 RPM extended spec definitions lines.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to add any ``%define`` lines to the generated spec file.  An
 example of its use is to prevent stripping of executables (but note that
 this may also disable other default post install processing)::

 set(CPACK_RPM_SPEC_MORE_DEFINE "%define __spec_install_post /bin/true")

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG

 Toggle CPack RPM generator debug output.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be set when invoking cpack in order to trace debug information
 during CPack RPM run. For example you may launch CPack like this::

 cpack -D CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_DEBUG=1 -G RPM

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE
              CPACK_RPM_<componentName>_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE

 A user provided spec file.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be set by the user in order to specify a USER binary spec file
 to be used by the CPack RPM generator instead of generating the file.
 The specified file will be processed by configure_file( @ONLY).

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE

 Spec file template.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 If set CPack will generate a template for USER specified binary
 spec file and stop with an error. For example launch CPack like this::

  cpack -D CPACK_RPM_GENERATE_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE_TEMPLATE=1 -G RPM

 The user may then use this file in order to hand-craft is own
 binary spec file which may be used with
 :variable:`CPACK_RPM_USER_BINARY_SPECFILE`.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
              CPACK_RPM_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE

 Path to file containing pre (un)install script.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to embed a pre (un)installation script in the spec file.
 The referred script file (or both) will be read and directly
 put after the ``%pre`` or ``%preun`` section
 If ``CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL`` is set to ON the (un)install
 script for each component can be overridden with
 ``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PRE_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE`` and
 ``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PRE_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE``.
 One may verify which scriptlet has been included with::

 rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE
              CPACK_RPM_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE

 Path to file containing post (un)install script.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to embed a post (un)installation script in the spec file.
 The referred script file (or both) will be read and directly
 put after the ``%post`` or ``%postun`` section.
 If ``CPACK_RPM_COMPONENT_INSTALL`` is set to ON the (un)install
 script for each component can be overridden with
 ``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_POST_INSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE`` and
 ``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_POST_UNINSTALL_SCRIPT_FILE``.
 One may verify which scriptlet has been included with::

 rpm -qp --scripts  package.rpm

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_USER_FILELIST
              CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_USER_FILELIST

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to explicitly specify ``%(<directive>)`` file line
 in the spec file. Like ``%config(noreplace)`` or any other directive
 that be found in the ``%files`` section. You can have multiple directives
 per line, as in ``%attr(600,root,root) %config(noreplace)``. Since
 the CPack RPM generator is generating the list of files (and directories) the
 user specified files of the ``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_USER_FILELIST`` list will
 be removed from the generated list. If referring to directories do
 not add a trailing slash.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_CHANGELOG_FILE

 RPM changelog file.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to embed a changelog in the spec file.
 The referred file will be read and directly put after the ``%changelog``
 section.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST

 list of path to be excluded.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : /etc /etc/init.d /usr /usr/bin /usr/include /usr/lib
               /usr/libx32 /usr/lib64 /usr/share /usr/share/aclocal
               /usr/share/doc

 May be used to exclude path (directories or files) from the auto-generated
 list of paths discovered by CPack RPM. The default value contains a
 reasonable set of values if the variable is not defined by the user. If the
 variable is defined by the user then the CPack RPM generator will NOT any of
 the default path. If you want to add some path to the default list then you
 can use ``CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION`` variable.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST_ADDITION

 additional list of path to be excluded.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to add more exclude path (directories or files) from the initial
 default list of excluded paths. See
 ``CPACK_RPM_EXCLUDE_FROM_AUTO_FILELIST``.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_RELOCATION_PATHS

 Packages relocation paths list.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to specify more than one relocation path per relocatable RPM.
 Variable contains a list of relocation paths that if relative are prefixed
 by the value of ``CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREFIX`` or by the
 value of ``CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX`` if the component version
 is not provided.
 Variable is not component based as its content can be used to set a different
 path prefix for e.g. binary dir and documentation dir at the same time.
 Only prefixes that are required by a certain component are added to that
 component - component must contain at least one file/directory/symbolic link
 with ``CPACK_RPM_RELOCATION_PATHS`` prefix for a certain relocation
 path to be added. Package will not contain any relocation paths if there are
 no files/directories/symbolic links on any of the provided prefix locations.
 Packages that either do not contain any relocation paths or contain
 files/directories/symbolic links that are outside relocation paths print
 out an ``AUTHOR_WARNING`` that RPM will be partially relocatable.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREFIX

 Per component relocation path install prefix.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX

 May be used to set per component ``CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX``
 for relocatable RPM packages.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_NO_INSTALL_PREFIX_RELOCATION
              CPACK_RPM_NO_<COMPONENT>_INSTALL_PREFIX_RELOCATION

 Removal of default install prefix from relocation paths list.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX or CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREFIX
               are treated as one of relocation paths

 May be used to remove CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX and CPACK_RPM_<COMPONENT>_PACKAGE_PREFIX
 from relocatable RPM prefix paths.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_ADDITIONAL_MAN_DIRS

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

 May be used to set additional man dirs that could potentially be compressed
 by brp-compress RPM macro. Variable content must be a list of regular
 expressions that point to directories containing man files or to man files
 directly. Note that in order to compress man pages a path must also be
 present in brp-compress RPM script and that brp-compress script must be
 added to RPM configuration by the operating system.

 Regular expressions that are added by default were taken from brp-compress
 RPM macro:

 - /usr/man/man.*
 - /usr/man/.*/man.*
 - /usr/info.*
 - /usr/share/man/man.*
 - /usr/share/man/.*/man.*
 - /usr/share/info.*
 - /usr/kerberos/man.*
 - /usr/X11R6/man/man.*
 - /usr/lib/perl5/man/man.*
 - /usr/share/doc/.*/man/man.*
 - /usr/lib/.*/man/man.*

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_USER
              CPACK_RPM_<compName>_DEFAULT_USER

 default user ownership of RPM content

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : root

 Value should be user name and not UID.
 Note that <compName> must be in upper-case.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_GROUP
              CPACK_RPM_<compName>_DEFAULT_GROUP

 default group ownership of RPM content

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : root

 Value should be group name and not GID.
 Note that <compName> must be in upper-case.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS
              CPACK_RPM_<compName>_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS

 default permissions used for packaged files

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : - (system default)

 Accepted values are lists with ``PERMISSIONS``. Valid permissions
 are:

 - OWNER_READ
 - OWNER_WRITE
 - OWNER_EXECUTE
 - GROUP_READ
 - GROUP_WRITE
 - GROUP_EXECUTE
 - WORLD_READ
 - WORLD_WRITE
 - WORLD_EXECUTE

 Note that <compName> must be in upper-case.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_DIR_PERMISSIONS
              CPACK_RPM_<compName>_DEFAULT_DIR_PERMISSIONS

 default permissions used for packaged directories

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : - (system default)

 Accepted values are lists with PERMISSIONS. Valid permissions
 are the same as for ``CPACK_RPM_DEFAULT_FILE_PERMISSIONS``.
 Note that <compName> must be in upper-case.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_INSTALL_WITH_EXEC

 force execute permissions on programs and shared libraries

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : - (system default)

 Force set owner, group and world execute permissions on programs and shared
 libraries. This can be used for creating valid rpm packages on systems such
 as Debian where shared libraries do not have execute permissions set.

.. note::

 Programs and shared libraries without execute permissions are ignored during
 separation of debug symbols from the binary for debuginfo packages.

Packaging of Symbolic Links
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The CPack RPM generator supports packaging of symbolic links::

 execute_process(COMMAND ${CMAKE_COMMAND}
   -E create_symlink <relative_path_location> <symlink_name>)
 install(FILES ${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/<symlink_name>
   DESTINATION <symlink_location> COMPONENT libraries)

Symbolic links will be optimized (paths will be shortened if possible)
before being added to the package or if multiple relocation paths are
detected, a post install symlink relocation script will be generated.

Symbolic links may point to locations that are not packaged by the same
package (either a different component or even not packaged at all) but
those locations will be treated as if they were a part of the package
while determining if symlink should be either created or present in a
post install script - depending on relocation paths.

Symbolic links that point to locations outside packaging path produce a
warning and are treated as non relocatable permanent symbolic links.

Currently there are a few limitations though:

* For component based packaging component interdependency is not checked
  when processing symbolic links. Symbolic links pointing to content of
  a different component are treated the same way as if pointing to location
  that will not be packaged.

* Symbolic links pointing to a location through one or more intermediate
  symbolic links will not be handled differently - if the intermediate
  symbolic link(s) is also on a relocatable path, relocating it during
  package installation may cause initial symbolic link to point to an
  invalid location.

Packaging of debug information
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Debuginfo packages contain debug symbols and sources for debugging packaged
binaries.

Debuginfo RPM packaging has its own set of variables:

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE

 Enable generation of debuginfo RPM package(s).

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

.. note::

 Binaries must contain debug symbols before packaging so use either ``Debug``
 or ``RelWithDebInfo`` for ``CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`` variable value.

.. note::

 Packages generated from packages without binary files, with binary files but
 without execute permissions or without debug symbols will cause packaging
 termination.

.. variable:: CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS

 Provides locations of root directories of source files from which binaries
 were built.

 * Mandatory : YES if ``CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE`` is set
 * Default   : -

.. note::

 For CMake project ``CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS`` is set by default to
 point to ``CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR`` and ``CMAKE_BINARY_DIR`` paths.

.. note::

 Sources with path prefixes that do not fall under any location provided with
 ``CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS`` will not be present in debuginfo package.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX

 Prefix of location where sources will be placed during package installation.

 * Mandatory : YES if ``CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE`` is set
 * Default   : "/usr/src/debug/<CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>" and
               for component packaging "/usr/src/debug/<CPACK_PACKAGE_FILE_NAME>-<component>"

.. note::

 Each source path prefix is additionally suffixed by ``src_<index>`` where
 index is index of the path used from ``CPACK_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS``
 variable. This produces ``<CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX>/src_<index>``
 replacement path.
 Limitation is that replaced path part must be shorter or of equal
 length than the length of its replacement. If that is not the case either
 ``CPACK_RPM_BUILD_SOURCE_DIRS_PREFIX`` variable has to be set to
 a shorter path or source directories must be placed on a longer path.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_EXCLUDE_DIRS

 Directories containing sources that should be excluded from debuginfo packages.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : "/usr /usr/src /usr/src/debug"

 Listed paths are owned by other RPM packages and should therefore not be
 deleted on debuginfo package uninstallation.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_EXCLUDE_DIRS_ADDITION

 Paths that should be appended to ``CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_EXCLUDE_DIRS``
 for exclusion.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_SINGLE_PACKAGE

 Create a single debuginfo package even if components packaging is set.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

 When this variable is enabled it produces a single debuginfo package even if
 component packaging is enabled.

 When using this feature in combination with components packaging and there is
 more than one component this variable requires ``CPACK_RPM_MAIN_COMPONENT``
 to be set.

.. note::

 If none of the ``CPACK_RPM_<component>_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE`` variables
 is set then ``CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_PACKAGE`` is automatically set to
 ``ON`` when ``CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_SINGLE_PACKAGE`` is set.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_DEBUGINFO_FILE_NAME
              CPACK_RPM_<component>_DEBUGINFO_FILE_NAME

 Debuginfo package file name.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : rpmbuild tool generated package file name

 Alternatively provided debuginfo package file name must end with ``.rpm``
 suffix and should differ from file names of other generated packages.

 Variable may contain ``@cpack_component@`` placeholder which will be
 replaced by component name if component packaging is enabled otherwise it
 deletes the placeholder.

 Setting the variable to ``RPM-DEFAULT`` may be used to explicitly set
 filename generation to default.

.. note::

 ``CPACK_RPM_FILE_NAME`` also supports rpmbuild tool generated package
 file name - disabled by default but can be enabled by setting the variable to
 ``RPM-DEFAULT``.

Packaging of sources (SRPM)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

SRPM packaging is enabled by setting ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SOURCES``
variable while usually using ``CPACK_INSTALLED_DIRECTORIES`` variable
to provide directory containing CMakeLists.txt and source files.

For CMake projects SRPM package would be produced by executing::

 cpack -G RPM --config ./CPackSourceConfig.cmake

.. note::

 Produced SRPM package is expected to be built with ``cmake(1)`` executable
 and packaged with ``cpack(1)`` executable so CMakeLists.txt has to be
 located in root source directory and must be able to generate binary rpm
 packages by executing ``cpack -G`` command. The two executables as well as
 rpmbuild must also be present when generating binary rpm packages from the
 produced SRPM package.

Once the SRPM package is generated it can be used to generate binary packages
by creating a directory structure for rpm generation and executing rpmbuild
tool::

 mkdir -p build_dir/{BUILD,BUILDROOT,RPMS,SOURCES,SPECS,SRPMS}
 rpmbuild --define "_topdir <path_to_build_dir>" --rebuild <SRPM_file_name>

Generated packages will be located in build_dir/RPMS directory or its sub
directories.

.. note::

 SRPM package internally uses CPack/RPM generator to generate binary packages
 so CMakeScripts.txt can decide during the SRPM to binary rpm generation step
 what content the package(s) should have as well as how they should be packaged
 (monolithic or components). CMake can decide this for e.g. by reading environment
 variables set by the package manager before starting the process of generating
 binary rpm packages. This way a single SRPM package can be used to produce
 different binary rpm packages on different platforms depending on the platform's
 packaging rules.

Source RPM packaging has its own set of variables:

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SOURCES

 Should the content be packaged as a source rpm (default is binary rpm).

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : OFF

.. note::

 For cmake projects ``CPACK_RPM_PACKAGE_SOURCES`` variable is set
 to ``OFF`` in CPackConfig.cmake and ``ON`` in CPackSourceConfig.cmake
 generated files.

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_SOURCE_PKG_BUILD_PARAMS

 Additional command-line parameters provided to ``cmake(1)`` executable.

 * Mandatory : NO
 * Default   : -

.. variable:: CPACK_RPM_SOURCE_PKG_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX

 Packaging install prefix that would be provided in ``CPACK_PACKAGING_INSTALL_PREFIX``
 variable for producing binary RPM packages.

 * Mandatory : YES
 * Default   : "/"


CPack WIX Generator
-------------------

CPack WIX generator specific options

Variables specific to CPack WIX generator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following variables are specific to the installers built on
Windows using WiX.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID

 Upgrade GUID (``Product/@UpgradeCode``)

 Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.

 It should be explicitly set to a constant generated globally unique
 identifier (GUID) to allow your installers to replace existing
 installations that use the same GUID.

 You may for example explicitly set this variable in your
 CMakeLists.txt to the value that has been generated per default.  You
 should not use GUIDs that you did not generate yourself or which may
 belong to other projects.

 A GUID shall have the following fixed length syntax::

  XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX

 (each X represents an uppercase hexadecimal digit)

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_GUID

 Product GUID (``Product/@Id``)

 Will be automatically generated unless explicitly provided.

 If explicitly provided this will set the Product Id of your installer.

 The installer will abort if it detects a pre-existing installation that
 uses the same GUID.

 The GUID shall use the syntax described for CPACK_WIX_UPGRADE_GUID.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF

 RTF License File

 If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .rtf extension it is used as-is.

 If CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE has an .txt extension it is implicitly
 converted to RTF by the WIX Generator.
 The expected encoding of the .txt file is UTF-8.

 With CPACK_WIX_LICENSE_RTF you can override the license file used by the
 WIX Generator in case CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE is in an unsupported
 format or the .txt -> .rtf conversion does not work as expected.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_PRODUCT_ICON

 The Icon shown next to the program name in Add/Remove programs.

 If set, this icon is used in place of the default icon.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_UI_REF

 This variable allows you to override the Id of the ``<UIRef>`` element
 in the WiX template.

 The default is ``WixUI_InstallDir`` in case no CPack components have
 been defined and ``WixUI_FeatureTree`` otherwise.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_UI_BANNER

 The bitmap will appear at the top of all installer pages other than the
 welcome and completion dialogs.

 If set, this image will replace the default banner image.

 This image must be 493 by 58 pixels.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_UI_DIALOG

 Background bitmap used on the welcome and completion dialogs.

 If this variable is set, the installer will replace the default dialog
 image.

 This image must be 493 by 312 pixels.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_PROGRAM_MENU_FOLDER

 Start menu folder name for launcher.

 If this variable is not set, it will be initialized with CPACK_PACKAGE_NAME

 If this variable is set to ``.``, then application shortcuts will be
 created directly in the start menu and the uninstaller shortcut will be
 omitted.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_CULTURES

 Language(s) of the installer

 Languages are compiled into the WixUI extension library.  To use them,
 simply provide the name of the culture.  If you specify more than one
 culture identifier in a comma or semicolon delimited list, the first one
 that is found will be used.  You can find a list of supported languages at:
 http://wix.sourceforge.net/manual-wix3/WixUI_localization.htm

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_TEMPLATE

 Template file for WiX generation

 If this variable is set, the specified template will be used to generate
 the WiX wxs file.  This should be used if further customization of the
 output is required.

 If this variable is not set, the default MSI template included with CMake
 will be used.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_PATCH_FILE

 Optional list of XML files with fragments to be inserted into
 generated WiX sources

 This optional variable can be used to specify an XML file that the
 WIX generator will use to inject fragments into its generated
 source files.

 Patch files understood by the CPack WIX generator
 roughly follow this RELAX NG compact schema:

 .. code-block:: none

    start = CPackWiXPatch

    CPackWiXPatch = element CPackWiXPatch { CPackWiXFragment* }

    CPackWiXFragment = element CPackWiXFragment
    {
        attribute Id { string },
        fragmentContent*
    }

    fragmentContent = element * - CPackWiXFragment
    {
        (attribute * { text } | text | fragmentContent)*
    }

 Currently fragments can be injected into most
 Component, File, Directory and Feature elements.

 The following additional special Ids can be used:

 * ``#PRODUCT`` for the ``<Product>`` element.
 * ``#PRODUCTFEATURE`` for the root ``<Feature>`` element.

 The following example illustrates how this works.

 Given that the WIX generator creates the following XML element:

 .. code-block:: xml

    <Component Id="CM_CP_applications.bin.my_libapp.exe" Guid="*"/>

 The following XML patch file may be used to inject an Environment element
 into it:

 .. code-block:: xml

    <CPackWiXPatch>
      <CPackWiXFragment Id="CM_CP_applications.bin.my_libapp.exe">
        <Environment Id="MyEnvironment" Action="set"
          Name="MyVariableName" Value="MyVariableValue"/>
      </CPackWiXFragment>
    </CPackWiXPatch>

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_EXTRA_SOURCES

 Extra WiX source files

 This variable provides an optional list of extra WiX source files (.wxs)
 that should be compiled and linked.  The full path to source files is
 required.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_EXTRA_OBJECTS

 Extra WiX object files or libraries

 This variable provides an optional list of extra WiX object (.wixobj)
 and/or WiX library (.wixlib) files.  The full path to objects and libraries
 is required.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_EXTENSIONS

 This variable provides a list of additional extensions for the WiX
 tools light and candle.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_<TOOL>_EXTENSIONS

 This is the tool specific version of CPACK_WIX_EXTENSIONS.
 ``<TOOL>`` can be either LIGHT or CANDLE.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_<TOOL>_EXTRA_FLAGS

 This list variable allows you to pass additional
 flags to the WiX tool ``<TOOL>``.

 Use it at your own risk.
 Future versions of CPack may generate flags which may be in conflict
 with your own flags.

 ``<TOOL>`` can be either LIGHT or CANDLE.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY

 If this variable is set the generated installer will create
 an entry in the windows registry key
 ``HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Kitware\CMake\Packages\<PackageName>``
 The value for ``<PackageName>`` is provided by this variable.

 Assuming you also install a CMake configuration file this will
 allow other CMake projects to find your package with
 the ``find_package()`` command.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_PROPERTY_<PROPERTY>

 This variable can be used to provide a value for
 the Windows Installer property ``<PROPERTY>``

 The following list contains some example properties that can be used to
 customize information under
 "Programs and Features" (also known as "Add or Remove Programs")

 * ARPCOMMENTS - Comments
 * ARPHELPLINK - Help and support information URL
 * ARPURLINFOABOUT - General information URL
 * ARPURLUPDATEINFO - Update information URL
 * ARPHELPTELEPHONE - Help and support telephone number
 * ARPSIZE - Size (in kilobytes) of the application

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FEATURE_TITLE

 Sets the name of the root install feature in the WIX installer. Same as
 CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DISPLAY_NAME for components.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FEATURE_DESCRIPTION

 Sets the description of the root install feature in the WIX installer. Same as
 CPACK_COMPONENT_<compName>_DESCRIPTION for components.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_SKIP_PROGRAM_FOLDER

 If this variable is set to true, the default install location
 of the generated package will be CPACK_PACKAGE_INSTALL_DIRECTORY directly.
 The install location will not be located relatively below
 ProgramFiles or ProgramFiles64.

  .. note::
    Installers created with this feature do not take differences
    between the system on which the installer is created
    and the system on which the installer might be used into account.

    It is therefore possible that the installer e.g. might try to install
    onto a drive that is unavailable or unintended or a path that does not
    follow the localization or convention of the system on which the
    installation is performed.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_ROOT_FOLDER_ID

 This variable allows specification of a custom root folder ID.
 The generator specific ``<64>`` token can be used for
 folder IDs that come in 32-bit and 64-bit variants.
 In 32-bit builds the token will expand empty while in 64-bit builds
 it will expand to ``64``.

 When unset generated installers will default installing to
 ``ProgramFiles<64>Folder``.

.. variable:: CPACK_WIX_ROOT

 This variable can optionally be set to the root directory
 of a custom WiX Toolset installation.

 When unspecified CPack will try to locate a WiX Toolset
 installation via the ``WIX`` environment variable instead.
