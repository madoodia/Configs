# For unloading , build and loading the plugin from inside maya:

# first we should have three files:
# 1. build.py
#   in this file we will do these:
#       1. unload the plugin
#       2. call build.bat with subprocess
#       3. load plugin

#
# 2. build.bat
#   in this file we will do these:
#       1. get the current directory (Plugin directory)
#       2. call vcvarsall.bat from visual studio to setup everything is needed
#       3. go to current directory 
#       4. call nmake (it will detect Makefile Automatically)

#
# 3. an empty __init__.py

#
# Finally:
# From inside maya we have to call build.py: (example)
#   import sys
#   pluginPath_ = "D:/madoodia/dev"
#   sys.path.append(pluginPath_)
#   import abyssal.build as build
#   reload(build)
#   build.run()
# 	# Just Load
#	# build.load()
