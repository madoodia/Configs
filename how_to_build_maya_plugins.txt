2 types of building:

1. inside visual studio and its configurations:

- For building maya plugins in Visual Studio you should create a new project
- Add all sources and header files to the project and set some configurations based on needs, default config is in the
needed_config.txt file in this path: D:\Madoodia\_gitlab\codelab\maya_api\_building_qt_maya_plugins_qith_qmake_nmake

TIP: Based on version of Visual Studio you are using for build, you have to shipp VCRedist related to that Visual Studio with the plugin

# -------------------------------------------------------
2. with makefile:

3 kind of plugins that need to have different makefiles:

Before builing Makefile with nmake command
You should run setup.bat file and use nmake in VisualStudio Command Prompt

1. Maya Plugins without Qt:

-You can use Makefile file in same directory as a template and change PROJECT_NAME and OBJECTS based on your source files
- Adding new libraries or include directories are possible for different project


2. Maya Plugins with Qt UI created by codes:
- This project is a sample file for plugins that use Qt with code not with QtDesigner
D:\Madoodia\_gitlab\codelab\maya_api\_building_qt_maya_plugins_qith_qmake_nmake\helixQtCmd_qmake_nmake
you can use its Makefile as template

3. Maya Plugins with Qt UI created by QtDesigner:
- Under investigation (Does not work yet)
- This project uses QtDesigner for designing UIs and you can use its Makefile as template
D:\Madoodia\_gitlab\codelab\maya_api\_building_qt_maya_plugins_qith_qmake_nmake\qform
