	// Place your snippets for cpp here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a prefix, body and 
	// description. The prefix is what is used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
	// $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders. Placeholders with the 
	// same ids are connected.
	// Example:
	"Copyright": {
		"prefix": "@",
		"body": [
			"// --------------------- //",
			"// (C) ${1:2024} madoodia.com //",
			"// --------------------- //",
			"",
			""
		],
		"description": "Create madoodia.com Copyright"
	},
	"CapitalizeWord": {
		"prefix": "capWord", // Trigger word for the snippet
		"body": [
			"${TM_SELECTED_TEXT/\\b([a-z])(\\w*)\\b/${1:/upcase}${2}/g}"
		],
		"description": "Capitalize first letter of selected word"
	}
